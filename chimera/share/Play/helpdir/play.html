Move multiscale chain surfaces radially from the center of all surfaces.
The center of each chain surface moves radially from the common center
for a total expansion by the specified factor over N frames.  Examples
of surface specifiers: #0, #1:1-30, #2:.A,.C, #3:.A-H, #4:31-60.S-V

<blockquote>
Moves multiscale chain pieces from an initial position to a final position.
The motion begins at the first chain and propagates out moving additional
chains based on their distance from already moved chains.
The pairings of chains between initial and final states can computed to
minimize overall motion.  The pairChains option specifies a correspondence
between initial and final chain identifiers.  For example
"pairChains A=S,B=T,C=U" identifies chains A,B,C in the intial state
as matching chains S,T,U in the final state.  If the option is not given
then the same chain identifiers in the initial and final states are matched.
The groupChains option allows moving 2 or more chains as a single rigid
object, for example "groupChains A+D,B+E,C+F" makes chains A and D move as
a single unit, likewise B and E, also C and F.
The equivalentChains option lists chains (or groups) in the initial state
are equivalent to each other for purposes of pairing initial state and
final state chains.  For example, "equivalentChains A=B=C" says that
chains A, B, and C are all interchangeable when pairing with final state
chains.  If chains are grouped then "equivalentChains A+D=B+E=C+F" can
express the groups that are equivalent for pairing. The pairingMethod option
specifies an algorithm for how chains of the initial state are paired
with those of the final state.  The default value "match" matches the
chain instance numbers, ie chains 1-60 match 1-60 in order.  The "push"
method matches an initial chain to the nearest final state chain position
that is not yet paired.  The "pull" method matches each final state chain
to the nearest initial state chain that has not been paired.  The "pushpull"
method does first push pairing then pull pairing in each layer of chains
where each layer consists of chains within distanceStep of the previous layer.
The push and pull methods can make the last moved chains fly a long
distance, while the pushpull method avoids this problem.  Paired chains
must have identical sets of atoms because the motion of the intial state
to the final state is computed by a minimum RMSD match between corresponding
atom positions. This 
command was developed for showing the conformational rearrangement of
dengue virus capsid proteins during virus maturation.

<blockquote>
Wiggle branches of a molecule back and forth where a branch is a contiguous
range of residues.  Each branch is rotated about an axis defined by two
end atoms.  One end atoms comes from a residue at each end of the contiguous
sequence defining the branch and has a bond to the next residue outside the
range of the branch.  The rotation angle from the original position varies
sinusoidally with time.  The speed of motion of a branch is inversely
proportional to the number of atoms in the branch.  The atoms argument
is the set in which the branches are defined while the branches argument
is a comma-separated list of residue ranges, each range defining defining
a branch, for example, "branches 35-85,53-65,121-290".  Then angle option
specifies the maximum rotation in degrees (default 10).  The speed option
(default 25) controls the speed of rotation, one wiggle oscillation taking
a number of frames equal to the number atoms in the branch divided by the speed.
The cycle time for a branch is adjust to the nearest value that makes a
half-integral number of cycles complete in the specified frames, so that
after the wiggle ends all atoms are in their original positions.  The
frames argument is the number of frames the motion is carried out over.
This command was developed to

<blockquote>
This command linearly intepolates the atom positions from an initial state
to a final state starting at one end of a chain of residues and progress
over time to the other end.  It moves the initial state to the final state
like the action of closing a zipper.  Each residue list must belong to
one molecule and the lists must have the same number of residues.  The
residues will be paired in the order they are specified.  The residue
numbers need not match.  Residues in list one are moved.  The atoms of
a residue in the first list are paired with the atoms of the corresponding
residue in the second list by matching atom names.  Unpaired atoms are not
moved. If f represents
the fraction for interpolating residue atoms with f = 0 being the initial
state and f = 1 being the final state then f varies with residue number
as a piecewise linear function, f = 1 for initial residues, then a linear
ramp down to 0, then f = 0 for final residues in the chain.  The linear
ramp is progressively moved from start to end of the chain, animating the
change.  The width of the linear ramp is proportional to the distance between
residue centers at the start of the ramp in the two states, that distance
being divided by the spacing parameter (default 3) to obtain the width
in number of residues.  Each frame the ramp advances by a number of residues
equal to the step parameter (default 1).  The step can be non-integer, for
example 0.1 for a slower motion.  Negative step values make the motion
begin at the last residue and proceed to the first.
This was originally used in an
<a href="http://youtu.be/i-__ufO9LYg">HIV RNA movie</a>
to show RNA being synthesized from a DNA template.
