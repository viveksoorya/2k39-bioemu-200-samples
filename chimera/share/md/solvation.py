# Solvation of a protein with water.
#
# The solvation procedure consists of three steps:
#
# - The universe containing the protein is scaled up, and the required
#   number of water molecules is added at random positions, but without
#   any overlap between molecules. The system is so dilute that random
#   placements are easily possible.
#
# - The universe is slowly scaled down do its original size, with
#   each scaling step followed by some energy minimization and
#   molecular dynamics steps.
#
# - A molecular dynamics run at constant pressure and temperature is
#   used to put the system into a well-defined thermodynamic state.
