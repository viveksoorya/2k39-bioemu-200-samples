The Programmer's Guide is under construction.
See also: <a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/Scripts"
target="_blank">Chimera Python scripts</a>
</p><p>
A working knowledge of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
is required for the Programmer's Guide to be useful.  The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html"
target="_blank">Python Tutorial</a>
is recommended for programmers who want a quick introduction to Python.
Non-programmers should
consult the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide"
target="_blank">Beginner's Guide to Python</a>
for some suggestions on where to begin.
</p>
<p>
If all you want to do is loop through a series of data files and perform a series
of Chimera commands on them (possibly including writing out results), this
<a href="basicPrimer.html">extremely basic primer</a>
covers how to do that.
For anything more complicated please keep reading.
</p>
<p>
The Chimera Programmer's Guide main component is an
<a href="Examples/index.html">Examples</a> section demonstrating
various useful Chimera programming interfaces.
There are also 
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/Scripts"
target="_blank">Chimera Python scripts</a> for performing various tasks that 
you may be able to use as a jumping-off point for developing your own script.
We recommend starting with the Examples, and then either using
an example script or examining the Chimera source
code for an extension that does something similar to what you want to
do and working from there.  You can also use Chimera's IDLE programming
shell with the dir(obj) and help(obj) functions to find out more about
the attributes and methods of particular objects.  The FAQ (below) can
also be helpful and questions to the
<a href="../feedback.html#developers">chimera-dev mailing list</a>
are usually quickly answered.
