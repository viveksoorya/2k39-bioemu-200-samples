<h2>
<a name="q1">
1) Where is the programming documentation?
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The
<a href="Examples/index.html">Programming Examples</a>
are a good source of information.
More information can be gleamed from the C++ header files for the Chimera
objects.
Those header files are available in the
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/sourcecode.html">source code</a> download.
Another source of object info is the <code>help()</code> function in
the Chimera's IDLE Python shell (under General Controls).
For example, <code>help(chimera.Atom)</code> will show (C++) methods and
attributes of Atom objects.
Even more information is available via chimera developer's mailing list,
<a href="mailto:chimera-dev@cgl.ucsf.edu">chimera-dev@cgl.ucsf.edu</a>.
The archived mailing list is at
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/pipermail/chimera-dev/">http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/pipermail/chimera-dev</a>.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q2">
2) How to emulate command-line functionality.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Commands available at the type-in command line are almost all implemented in
the Midas module's __init__.py file.  You can use the commands for convenience
in implementing the same functionality in your extension.  For example, to
color iron atoms red:
</p>

<pre>
import Midas
Midas.color('red', '@/element=Fe')
</pre>

<p>
A few commands related to processing command text (<i>e.g.</i> handling files
of commands) are in Midas.midas_text.  One in particular, makeCommand(),
allows you to use command-line syntax directly instead of determining the
proper arguments to a Midas module function.  So the above example of coloring
atoms red would look like this using runCommand():

<pre>
from chimera import runCommand
runCommand("color red @/element=Fe")
</pre>

<p>
Note that if the command text may contain errors (<i>e.g.</i> it is based
on user input), <code>runCommand()</code> can raise <code>MidasError</code>
(defined in the Midas module)
so in such cases you may want to embed the <code>runCommand()</code> in a 
<code>try/except</code> block.

<p>In pre-1.0 build 2107 versions of Chimera, the <code>runCommand()</code>
convenience function doesn't exist, so you'd have to use
the functionally identical <code>makeCommand()</code> as follows:

<pre>
import Midas
from Midas.midas_text import makeCommand
makeCommand("color red @/element=Fe")
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q3">
3) Passing arguments to scripts.
</a>
</h2>
Use the <code>--script</code> option to invoke a Python script
after all of the other arguments have been processed.
If more than than one script option is given,
the scripts are executed in the order given.
Each script is executed using the arguments enclosed along with it in quotes.
Any data files specified in the shell command line are opened before the
script is called.  For example:
<p>

<pre>
chimera --nogui --nostatus --script "script.py -r 2.3 -- -1.pdb" -- -4.pdb</pre>

Chimera would open the <code>-4.pdb</code> file,
and invoke <code>script.py</code> with the <a href="../UsersGuide/midas/runscript.html">runscript</a> command
so
<code>sys.argv</code> would be set to <code>['script.py', '-r', '2.3', '--', '-1.pdb']</code>.
The <code>--</code> argument terminates the options list
and is only necessary if
the next non-option argument has a leading dash.
<h3>
<a name="q3a">3a) Turning scripts into programs.</a>
</h3>
<p>
To make your Python script look like any other shell program,
you could provide an executable shell script as shown below.
The shell script accepts a subset of chimera options
and options for the Python script,
adds in a chimera option to show the Reply Log at startup,
then packages the Python script options into a single chimera option,
and invokes chimera with those options.
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
PYSCRIPT=PATH-TO-PYTHON_SCRIPT.py
CHIMERA=PATH-TO-CHIMERA
# Parse arguments to decide which are script arguments
# and which are chimera arguments.  In this case, --debug,
# --stereo, -n, --nogui, --nostatus, and --silent are chimera
# arguments.  And -r, and --radius are the script arguments.
# Note that accepting --argument options in shell scripts
# depends on having a newer version of getopt.

if `getopt -T &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1` ; [ $? = 4 ]
then
	TEMP=`getopt -o nr: --long radius:,debug,stereo:,nogui,nostatus,silent -n "$0" -- "$@"`
else
	TEMP=`getopt nr: "$@"`
fi
if [ $? != 0 ]
then
	printf "Usage: %s: [-r|--radius value] args\n" $0
	exit 2
fi
eval set -- "$TEMP"

# set initial chimera arguments, in this case always show the Reply Log
CHARGS=(--start "Reply Log")
while [ $1 != -- ]
do
        case "$1" in
	-r|--radius)
		PYSCRIPT="$PYSCRIPT $1 '$2'"
		shift 2;;
	-n|--debug|--nogui|--nostatus|--silent)
		CHARGS[${#CHARGS[@]}]=$1
		shift;;
	--stereo)
		CHARGS[${#CHARGS[@]}]=$1
		CHARGS[${#CHARGS[@]}]="$2"
		shift 2;;
	esac
done
shift # skip --
$CHIMERA "${CHARGS[@]}" --script "$PYSCRIPT" "$@"
</pre>

And the Python script would parse its arguments with:

<pre>
import getopt
try:
	opts, args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], 'r:', ['radius='])
except getopt.error, message:
	raise chimera.NonChimeraError("%s: %s" % (__name__, message))
radius = 1.0
for o in opts:
	if o[0] in ("-r", "--radius"):
		radius = o[1]
assert(len(args) == 0)
</pre>

<h3>
<a name="q3b">3b) Installing Python packages into Chimera.</a>
</h3>
<p>
To use a package from Chimera, you would need to install it with Chimera's Python.
Chimera's Python has the Python version number appended to it, so it will be named
python2.x (python2.7 when this was written; also on Windows add ".exe").  On non-Mac,
it will be found in &lt;your Chimera installation&gt;/bin.  On Mac it's in
Chimera.app/Contents/Resources/bin &mdash; don't use the one in
Chimera.app/Contents/MacOS!
<p>
The best way to install packages is with pip, using  
(Chimera's) <code>python2.x -m pip install <i>package</i></code>.
If the pip module is not found, you'll need to install it first with
(Chimera's) <code>python2.x -m ensurepip</code>.
Then <code>-m pip install</code> will work.
For packages not supported by pip, you will have to follow the installation
instructions that come with the package.

4) How to rotate/translate the camera.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Camera always points in -z direction.  There is no way to rotate it.
Instead, rotate all of the models.
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; v = chimera.viewer
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = v.camera
&gt;&gt;&gt; print c.center
(5.9539999961853027, -2.186500072479248, 10.296500205993652)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.center = (3, 2.5, 10)	# to translate camera
&gt;&gt;&gt; v.scaleFactor = 1.5		# to zoom camera
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q5">
5) How to rotate/translate individual models.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Xform object <a href="#q10">model.openState.xform</a>
retrieves a copy of the rotation and translation transformation for a model.
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; om = chimera.openModels
&gt;&gt;&gt; mlist = om.list()
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = mlist[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; axis = chimera.Vector(1, 0, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; angle = 90			# degrees
&gt;&gt;&gt; xf = chimera.Xform.rotation(axis, angle)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print m.openState.xform	# 3x3 rotation matrix
				# last column is translation
0.982695 0.121524 0.139793 -1.07064
0.0250348 0.660639 -0.750287 6.83425
-0.183531 0.740803 0.646164 6.35578
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.openState.globalXform(xf)
</pre>

<p>
Another method to change the transform
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curxform = m.openState.xform # get copy (not reference)
&gt;&gt;&gt; xf.premultiply(curxform)	 # changes xf
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.openState.xform = xf	 # set it
</pre>

<p>
To rotate relative to model's data axes use
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.openState.localXform(xf)
</pre>

<p>
or
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; curxform = m.openState.xform # get copy (not reference)
&gt;&gt;&gt; xf.multiply(curxform)	 # changes xf
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.openState.xform = xf	 # set it
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q6">
6) How to save the current view as an image.
</a>
</h2>

<pre>
import Midas
Midas.copy(file='/home/goddard/hoohoo.png', format='PNG')
# format can be 'PNG', 'JPEG', 'TIFF', 'PS', 'EPS'
</pre>

<h2>
<a name="q7">
7) Some attributes return a copy of an object.
</a>
</h2>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; xf = model.openState.xform	# xf is a copy of the model's Xform matrix.
&gt;&gt;&gt; xf.zRotate(45)		# This will not rotate the model.
</pre>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = model.atoms[0].color	# c is the MaterialColor object for the atom
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.ambientDiffuse = (1,0,0)	# The Atom color changes immediately to red.
</pre>

<p>
Some Chimera objects returned as attributes are always copies,
some are always references to the original object.
Objects that are always copied include
Xform, Vector, Point, Sphere, Element, MolResId, Coord, ....
Objects that are never copied include
Atom, Bond, PseudoBond, CoordSet, Molecule, Residue, RibbonStyle, ....
Object that can be copied have a <code>__copy__</code> method.
In order to know if an object type is passed by value is to look at the Chimera C++ header files.
Classes without a WrapPy base class are always copied.
This base class is part of the C++ to Python interface generation.

<h2>
<a name="q8">
8) Explanation of transparency for Surface_Model, MSMSModel and VRMLModel.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Volume viewer isosurfaces are Surface_Model objects defined by the
_surface.so C++ module.  The Surface_Model interface is given in the
surfmodel.h source code file.  By default these surfaces use OpenGL (1,1-alpha)
blending.  This means the color for a triangle is added to an image plus
the transparency (= 1-alpha) times the color from triangles in back
of this one.  As the transparency becomes greater, the brightness of
the triangle does not diminish.  In fact, more shows through from behind
the triangle
so it appears brighter.  The specular highlights stay bright
even if the triangle is black and fully transparent.  In Chimera 1730
a Surface_Model attribute transparency_blend_mode was added to allow
the more common (alpha,1-alpha) blend mode.  This is like the above mode
but the triangle color is multiplied by alpha
before being added to the image.  For highly transparent triangles
alpha is close to zero, and the triangle and specular highlights become
dim.
</p>

<p>
MSMS molecular surface models use (alpha, 1-alpha) blending.
They also use a 2 pass algorithm which is faster than sorting all the
triangles by depth, but gives the strictly correct appearance only
when the viewer looks through at most 2 surface layers.
</p>

<p>
VRML models use (alpha,1) blending.  That is they multiply triangle color
by alpha, but add in all of the color from triangles further back without
reducing it by the transparency factor.  This
is like complete transparency, where the triangle colors are just scaled
by the alpha value.  This is horrible looking unless you want complete
transparency.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q9">
9) Transparency displayed incorrectly when 2 or more models are transparent.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Chimera architecture only correctly displays transparency when at
most one transparent model is shown.  Any number of opaque models can
also be shown.  If two transparent models are shown, one will be drawn
after the other.  This will make one appear as if it is drawn entirely
on top of another even if they in actuality intersect.  The rearmost
model, may in fact appear to be in front.  This is because Chimera
sorts the triangles by depth within a single model as needed for
rendering transparency, but is not able to sort triangles by depth across
multiple models.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q10">
10) Explanation of openState attribute.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The <code>openState</code> attribute of a Model controls whether that model
is active for motion ('<code>.active</code>'), and contains the model's
transformation matrix ('<code>.xform</code>') and center of rotation
('<code>.cofr</code>').  Since some models must move in synchrony
(<i>e.g.</i> a molecule and its surface), OpenState instances may shared
among multiple models.  If you create a model that needs a shared
<code>openState</code> with another model, then when adding your model
to the list of open models with <code>chimera.openModels.add()</code>,
you should use the '<code>sameAs</code>' keyword to specify that other model.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="q11">
11) Memory leaks in scripts.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In the 1700 release, Chimera uses a substantial amount of memory to hold
molecular data, but does not have any large memory leaks to the best of
our knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> as structures are closed their memory usage 
will be reclaimed).  However, the memory is reclaimed by a task that runs
during idle times, so therefore scripts that loop through many structures,
opening and closing them, will have their memory use grow continuously
until the script finishes.  This will often cause the script to fail as
the Chimera process runs out of memory.
<p>
You can cause the memory-reclamation task to run during your script by
calling:
<pre>chimera.update.checkForChanges()</pre>
<p>
You would want to call this after closing models in your script.  Since
the checkForChanges() routine also allows
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/ProgrammersGuide/Examples/Main_AtomTrigger.html">triggers</a>
to fire, you might want to also put it after any code that opens models.
For example, the code that assigns surface categories to models runs
from a trigger callback, so adding a molecular surface may not work as
expected if checkForChanges() is not called after a molecule is opened.
<p>
In post-1700 releases and snapshots, checkForChanges() is called automatically
when models are opened or closed, so you will not need to insert these
calls into your code.

13) How to write out a PDB file containing the crystal unit cell.
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Here's code that creates the copies of a PDB molecule needed to fill
out a crystallographic unit cell, then writes all the copies to a new
PDB file.  This code uses the standard Chimera 1.0 build 1892 PDBmatrices
module, which uses the PDB SMTRY remarks or CRYST1 record to determine
the needed transformations.
</p>

<p>
You can run it without a graphical user interface as follows
<p>

<pre>
% chimera --nogui myfile.pdb writeunitcell.py
</pre>

<p>
where the writeunitcell.py file contains the script given below.
</p>

<pre>
# Get the Molecule that has already been opened
import chimera
m = chimera.openModels.list()[0]

# Get the symmetry matrices
import PDBmatrices
tflist = PDBmatrices.crystal_symmetry_matrices(m.pdbHeaders)

# Get center of bounding box
import Molecule
center = Molecule.molecule_center(m)

# Get CRYST1 line from PDB headers
cryst1 = m.pdbHeaders['CRYST1'][0]

# Getting crystal parameters
from PDBmatrices import crystal
cp = crystal.pdb_cryst1_parameters(cryst1)
a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma = cp[:6]

# Adjust matrices to produce close packing.
cpm = PDBmatrices.close_packing_matrices(tflist, center, center, a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma)

# Apply transformations to copies of Molecule
mlist = []
from PDBmatrices import matrices
path = m.openedAs[0]			# Path to original PDB file
for tf in cpm:
    xf = matrices.chimera_xform(tf)	# Chimera style transform matrix
    m.openState.globalXform(xf)
    mlist.append(m)
    m = chimera.openModels.open(path)[0]	# Open another copy

# Write PDB file with transformed copies of molecule

One way to access the Python code and other Chimera files on a Mac
is to right-click on the Chimera application icon
and choose "Show Package Contents" 
from the resulting pop-up menu.  Another way is to use Terminal.app
and the command "cd" to navigate into the Chimera.app directory and
its subdirectories.  Most files of interest can be found under
