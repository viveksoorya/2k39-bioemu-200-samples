<h1>
Looping Through Data Files and Running Chimera Commands on Them
</h1>
<h3>
<i>...and not much else</i>
</h3>

<h4>
Scenario
</h4>
<p>
This primer covers the scenario where you have a set of data files in
a folder and want to perform a series of Chimera commands on each one
in turn, writing out some kind of results file (<i>e.g.</i> image;
structure measurements; modified data file) for each.
Though this primer provides all the Python code needed to carry out
the scenario tasks, it would still be beneficial (though not strictly
necessary) for you to read the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html"
target="_blank">Python Tutorial</a>
(at least the first few sections)
in order to understand the code better and to be able to modify it
if needed in ways this primer doesn't cover.
</p>
<h4>
Broad Outline
</h4>
<p>
You will take the code below, modified for your needs, and place it in a
file ending with a '.py' suffix.  The '.py' suffix will indicate to Chimera
that the file should be interpreted as Python code.  You could then run
the Python code by opening the file with Chimera's
<a href="../UsersGuide/opensave.html#opendialog"><b>File&rarr;Open</b> dialog</a>
or with the
<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/open.html"><kbd>open</kbd> command</a>.
If you want to suppress the Chimera interface from appearing during your
script processing, you can
<a href="../UsersGuide/startup.html">start Chimera</a>
using the
<a href="../UsersGuide/options.html#nogui">--nogui option</a>
(<i>e.g.</i> <kbd>chimera --nogui processData.py</kbd>).
Note that if your script creates images then you <i>must</i> start
the Chimera interface unless you've downloaded the &quot;headless&quot;
version of Chimera (see the
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html">download page</a>).
</p>
<p>
An important fact to know is that any
<a href="../UsersGuide/framecommand.html">Chimera command</a>
can be executed in Python using the <code>runCommand()</code> call.
For instance, to color all models red and surface them:
<pre>
<samp>
from chimera import runCommand
runCommand("color red")
runCommand("surf")
</samp>
</pre>
This makes it simple to perform actions in your Python script as long as
you know the equivalent Chimera command.
</p>
<h4>
Scripting Approach
</h4>
<p>
The general scheme used in the script will be to enter the folder
containing your data files, gather the names of the files, and then
loop through them one by one, performing a series of commands on each.
In the example below the data files are PDB files (suffix: .pdb),
each of which has a ligand and a receptor.  The script focuses on the
ligand, attempts to ensure that the receptor isn't obscuring the ligand,
surfaces the receptor, and saves an image.
</p>
<h4>
The Script
</h4>
<p>
There are a lot of comments in the script describing the code.
Python comments are introduced by the <b>#</b> character
(as long as it's not inside a quoted string of course).
</p>
<pre>
<code>
import os
from chimera import runCommand as rc # use 'rc' as shorthand for runCommand
from chimera import replyobj # for emitting status messages

# change to folder with data files
os.chdir("/Users/pett/data")

# gather the names of .pdb files in the folder
file_names = [fn for fn in os.listdir(".") if fn.endswith(".pdb")]

# loop through the files, opening, processing, and closing each in turn
for fn in file_names:
	replyobj.status("Processing " + fn) # show what file we're working on
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/open.html">open</a> " + fn)
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/align.html">align</a> ligand ~ligand") # put ligand in front of remainder of molecule
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/focus.html">focus</a> ligand") # center/zoom ligand
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/surface.html">surf</a>") # surface receptor
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/preset.html">preset</a> apply publication 1") # make everything look nice
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/surftransparency.html">surftransp</a> 15") # make the surface a little bit see-through
	# save image to a file that ends in .png rather than .pdb
	png_name = fn[:-3] + "png"
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/copy.html">copy</a> file " + png_name + " supersample 3")
	rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/close.html">close</a> all")
# uncommenting the line below will cause Chimera to exit when the script is done
#rc("<a href="../UsersGuide/midas/stop.html">stop</a> now")
# note that indentation is significant in Python; the fact that
# the above command is exdented means that it is executed after
# the loop completes, whereas the indented commands that 
# preceded it are executed as part of the loop.
</code>

<h4>
Actual Script File
</h4>
<p>
Here is a
<a href="processData.py">link</a>
to an actual file containing the script so that you can download it and
use it as a starting point for your own script &mdash; and save yourself
some typing.
</p>
<h4>
Addendum
</h4>
<p>
Frequently execution of your script will put information in the Reply Log
that you want to save.
If you are running with the "--nogui" option, then log output will simpy go
to the shell that you run Chimera from, which you can then
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html">redirect</a> to a file.
If you are running with the graphical user interface, then adding these lines to your script will save the
contents of the Reply Log into a file named &quot;reply-log.txt&quot; in
your home folder:
<pre>
<code>
from chimera.tkgui import saveReplyLog
saveReplyLog("~/reply-log.txt")
</code>
</pre>
</p>
</body>
</html>
