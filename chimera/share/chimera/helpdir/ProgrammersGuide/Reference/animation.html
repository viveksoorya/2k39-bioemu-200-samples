<h1>
Making Tools Scene- and Animation-aware
</h1>

<p>
Chimera version 1.7 (November 5, 2012)
</p>

<p>
The Animate package implements both scene and animation functionality.
Core attributes such as model names, residue types and atom positions are
handled automatically by the Animate package.  Tools
are responsible for saving, restoring and animating objects and
attributes that they introduce.  Notification of scene and animation events
happen through the standard Chimera trigger mechanism.
</p>

<h2>Scene Triggers</h2>

<p>
There are two triggers associated with scenes:
<dl>
<dt><code>chimera.SCENE_TOOL_SAVE</code></dt>
<dd>This trigger is fired when a scene is created or updated.
The core attributes have already been saved.  The trigger
data argument to registered handlers is the scene object.</dd>
<dt><code>chimera.SCENE_TOOL_RESTORE</code></dt>
<dd>This trigger is fired when a scene is restored (and
just before an animation sequence completes,
<a href="#finish">see below</a>).
The core attributes have already been restored.  The trigger
data argument to registered handlers is the scene object.</dd>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
Each scene object has a dictionary, <code>tool_settings</code>,
for managing tool-specific data.  Tools are responsible for creating
their own keys and values for storing and accessing data in the
dictionary.  Singleton tools such as <b>2DLabels</b>
can use fixed strings such as &quot;2D Labels (gui)&quot; as their
keys; multi-instance tools will need to come up with unique keys and
make sure that they are not overwriting data for some other tool.
Typically, data is saved in <code>SCENE_TOOL_SAVE</code> and accessed
in <code>SCENE_TOOL_RESTORE</code> handlers.
</p>

<h2>Animation Triggers</h2>

<p>
<code>Animate</code> updates the graphics display during
transitions.  There are three types of transitions:
<dl>
<dt>key frame transition</dt>
<dd>When the user plays the animation, a transition occurs
between each sequential pair of timeline items.
 If the ending item is a key frame,
then a playback transition results.  To transform from the starting state
to the ending key frame state, data values are interpolated over the
number of steps associated with the end key frame (the value
is stored in the <code>frames</code> attribute of the key frame).
There is a static &quot;transition&quot; for the initial frame if
it has a non-zero <code>frames</code> value.</dd>
<dt>scene transition</dt>
<dd>When the user selects a scene (either from the <b>Scenes</b> list
or by double-clicking on a key frame in the time line) , a transition with
default parameters is used.  Currently, the &quot;transition&quot;
is a one-frame update to the selected scene.</dd>
<dt>action transition</dt>
<dd>When an animation is played and one of the timeline items
is an <b>action</b> rather than a <b>key frame</b>, an action
transition results.  None of the triggers listed below are fired
for action transitions because the target state is unknown.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
There are four triggers associated with key frame and scene transitions:
<dl>
<dt><code>chimera.ANIMATION_TRANSITION_START</code></dt>
<dd>This trigger is fired when a transition from one key
frame to the next starts.  No core attributes have
been updated yet, so Chimera data represents the
initial state of the transition.  The trigger
data argument to registered handlers is the transition object.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dt><code>chimera.ANIMATION_TRANSITION_STEP</code></dt>
<dd>This trigger is fired for each step of the transition from one
key frame to the next.  The core attributes have already
been updated.  The trigger
data argument to registered handlers is the transition object.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dt><code>chimera.ANIMATION_TRANSITION_FINISH</code></dt>
<dd>This trigger is fired after all steps of the transition from one
key frame to the next have been completed.
The trigger data argument to registered handlers is the transition object.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dt><code>chimera.SCENE_TOOL_RESTORE</code></dt>
<dd><a name="finish">
This trigger is fired just prior to the
<code>ANIMATION_TRANSITION_FINISH</code>.  The purpose for firing
this trigger is to simplify writing tools that do not need
step-by-step animation yet want to restore state when a scene
state is reached.  These tools can just register for the
<code>SCENE_TOOL_RESTORE</code>
trigger and completely ignore the <code>ANIMATION_TRANSITION_*</code>
triggers.  Tools that wants to handle both step-by-step animation
and scene restoration will need to avoid getting the
<code>SCENE_TOOL_RESTORE</code> trigger twice by deregistering for
it in <code>ANIMATION_TRANSITION_START</code> and reregistering for
it in <code>ANIMATION_TRANSITION_FINISH</code>.
</a></dd>
</p>

<p>
The transition object received by handlers has several useful attributes
and methods:
<dl>
<dt><code>frames</code></dt>
<dd>The total number of frames in this transition.</dd>
<dt><code>frameCount</code></dt>
<dd>The step number of the current frame in the transition.
For <code>ANIMATION_TRANSITION_START</code>, this value should always be zero.
For <code>ANIMATION_TRANSTION_STEP</code>,
this value ranges from 1 to <code>frames</code>, inclusive.
For <code>ANIMATION_TRANSITION_FINISH</code>,
this value should be the same as <code>frames</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>target()</code></dt>
<dd>The end point for this transition, usually an instance
of <code>Animate.Keyframe.Keyframe</code> for movie playback or
<code>Animate.Scene.Scene</code> for scene restoration using the
default transition.</dd>
<dt><code>scene()</code></dt>
<dd>The scene at the end point for this transition, or None
if the target is neither a <code>Keyframe</code> nor a <code>Scene</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>tool_settings</code></dt>
<dd>A dictionary for managing tool-specific data in the
same manner as scene objects.
Unlike the dictionary in scene objects,
the <code>tool_settings</code> in transition objects are transient.
When a transition completes, the dictionary is automatically
removed and any stored data will be lost.
