<h2>Software Embedded in UCSF Chimera</h2>

<blockquote><p>
The list below includes links to 
where you can obtain the source-code distributions
for some of the software packages incorporated into Chimera.
All of this software comes bundled with the Chimera release;
the links are included here mainly for completeness.
In principle, you could upgrade to newer versions of these packages,
but it is recommended you wait for a new Chimera release instead, 
primarily because we incorporate bug fixes needed by Chimera that
may not have been added to the directly distributed versions yet.
The bug fixes are available as patch files in the
<a href="http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/browser/trunk/foreign/">
Chimera SVN repository</a> in subdirectories corresponding to the
various packages.

However, many people have contributed to it.
It is a classic open source effort that nobody "owns".
