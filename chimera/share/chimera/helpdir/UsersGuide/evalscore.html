<h2>EvalScore (CASP Assessment Tool)</h2>
<p>
<b>EvalScore</b> reads a <a href="#format">score file</a> that contains:
<ul>
<li> a list of reference and model (predicted) structures 
<li> two evaluation scores per model
</ul>
The models are shown as dots on a 2D plot, 
with one score along the X axis and the other along Y. 
Clicking a dot in the plot shows the reference structure and
the corresponding model side-by-side in the main Chimera window.
</p>

<a name="format">
<h3>Score File Format</h3></a>
<p>
Each line in the score file is of the format:
<blockquote><tt>
<i>refstruct</i>/<i>modelstruct</i>(Tab)<i>score1</i>(Tab)<i>score2</i>
</tt></blockquote>
where <i>refstruct</i> and <i>modelstruct</i> are the filenames of 
reference and model PDB files in the same directory as the score file.
If the actual name of a PDB file includes the &ldquo;.pdb&rdquo; suffix,
that part can be omitted from the name given in the score file.
The <i>score1</i> and <i>score2</i> values are floating-point numbers.
The &ldquo;/&rdquo; and (Tab) characters must be present.
</p><p>
Simply <a href="filetypes.html">opening</a>
a score file automatically starts <b>EvalScore</b>, generates
the plot, and connects the plot to the structures.  
The file type can be indicated by the suffix <b>.score</b> (part
of the filename) or the prefix <b>score:</b> 
(used in the command line, not part of the filename).
</p><p>
The background color of the Chimera window is initially set to a dark gray,
but can be <a href="chimerawindow.html#bg_color">changed</a> as desired.

<h3>Score-Score Plot and Interaction with Structures</h3></a>
<p>
Each predicted structure is represented by a dot on a 2D plot 
with X = <i>score1</i> and Y = <i>score2</i>.
Initially, all of the dots are red.  
When the mouse focus is in the plot, the X,Y coordinates of the cursor 
are reported on the lower right.
It may be necessary to click into the plot window to give it the mouse focus.
Clicking on a dot makes it blue and shows the reference and 
corresponding model structures in the main Chimera window, with
the reference on the left (at least initially).
In the plot window, a &ldquo;swoosh&rdquo; mark is drawn from
the dot to information above the plot about the structures and scores.
</p><p>
Secondary structure elements (SSEs) in the reference structure are
assigned successive colors along the rainbow in N&rarr;C order
starting with blue and ending with red.  
Residues in the predicted structure are colored to match those in the reference;
a given residue will be the same color in both structures regardless
of any helix and strand assignments in the predicted structure.
To generate the initial view, 
the structures are superimposed and then translated apart 
so that their orientations will be as similar as possible
(<a href="#details">details...</a>).
</p><p>
By default, both structures will orbit a single center
of rotation, but they can be made to rotate around individual centers using
the command <a href="midas/set.html#independent"><b>set independent</b></a>
or the <a href="sideview.html#rotation"><b>Rotation</b></a> tool.
</p><p>
Below the plot are standard
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/saxs/saxs.html#plotnav">plot navigation 
icons</a> provided by <a href="https://matplotlib.org/"
target="_blank">matplotlib</a>. 
Clicking <b>Close</b> dismisses the plot window; <b>Help</b>
opens this manual page in a browser window.

<h3>Details</h3></a>
<p>
To generate the initial view, the predicted structure (model #1)
is superimposed onto the reference (model #0) and then translated to
the right, as if the following commands were executed:
<blockquote><b>
<a href="midas/mmaker.html">mm</a> #0 #1 ssFraction false computeSS false
<br>
<a href="midas/move.html">move</a> x 50 model #1;
<a href="midas/focus.html">focus</a>
</b></blockquote>
The <a href="midas/focus.html"><b>focus</b></a> command ensures that the
entire structures are visible in the Chimera window.
