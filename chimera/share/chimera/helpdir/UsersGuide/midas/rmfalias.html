<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>rmfalias</b>
[&nbsp;depth&nbsp;<i>N</i>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;skip_prefix&nbsp;<i>M</i>&nbsp;]
[&nbsp;rmf&nbsp;<i>filename</i>&nbsp;]
</h3>
<p>
The <b>rmfalias</b> command creates command-line specifiers 
for sets of nodes in <a href="https://integrativemodeling.org/rmf/format.html"
target="_blank">Rich Molecular Format</a> (RMF)
currently open in <a href="../rmfviewer.html"><b>RMF Viewer</b></a>.
This allows acting on the node sets with
<a href="../framecommand.html" target="_top">Chimera commands</a>.
The resulting aliases are of the form:
<blockquote>
<i>filename</i>/<i>nodename1</i>/<i>nodename2</i>/<i>nodename3</i>
</blockquote>
with up to <i>N</i> levels aliased
(default <b>4</b>, up to the third level of nodes) and
the names of <i>M</i> levels omitted from the start of the alias
(default <b>1</b>, omitting <i>filename</i>).
The node names are read from the RMF file and shown in the
<a href="../rmfviewer.html"><b>RMF Viewer</b></a> interface.
Certain characters such as dots (periods) and colons are stripped.
The resulting aliases are listed in the 
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
</p><p>
For example, nodeset aliases for a file named &ldquo;myfile.rmf3&rdquo;
could include &ldquo;P0/Rpb1&rdquo; and &ldquo;P0/Rpb1/beads&rdquo;
(<i>N</i>&ge;4, <i>M</i>=1). Caution is warranted in skipping more than
1 level of prefix (<i>M</i>&gt;1), as that could produce non-unique
(duplicate) alias strings.  In the case of duplicates,
only the last of the potential assignments will apply.
</p><p>
Option keywords for <b>rmfalias</b>
can be truncated to unique strings, and their case does not matter.
The <b>rmf</b> keyword can be used to limit alias assignment to
<i>filename</i> when more than one RMF file is open.
The path to the file should not be included in <i>filename</i>.
