By default, when <a href="../representation.html#ribbon">ribbon</a> is shown, 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#mainchain">mainchain atoms</a>
(backbone atoms) are hidden and their locations are adjusted 
to fall on the ribbon. The ribbon
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">
residue class</a> determines which atoms are considered mainchain.
The <b>amino acid</b> and <b>nucleic acid</b> classes are built into Chimera,
but additional classes can be created with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html"><b>Ribbon
Style Editor</b></a>.

<b>Ribbackbone</b> allows displaying backbone atoms at
their unadjusted positions at the same time as ribbon 
(of course, these atoms can still be undisplayed).
<b>~Ribbackbone</b> restores the default behavior.
If the <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">
<i>atom-spec</i></a> is blank,
all open molecule models will be affected; otherwise,
the entire model(s) containing <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">
<i>atom-spec</i></a> will be affected.
Whether ribbon and backbone atoms can be displayed simultaneously
for residues within a model can also be controlled in the
<a href="../moleculeattrib.html">molecule model attributes panel</a>.
</p><p>
The ribbon follows a smooth, interpolated path that in some places
may not overlap well with the backbone atoms. 
Displayed in their true positions, these atoms may appear to be 
&ldquo;floating&rdquo; away from the ribbon. 
The method of path calculation can be controlled with
<a href="ribspline.html"><b>ribspline</b></a>; a cardinal spline may be
preferred over the default B-spline for more closely tracking the backbone
atom positions
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#offset">more...</a>).
