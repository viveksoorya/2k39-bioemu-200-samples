<p>
<b>Move</b> translates the specified <b>models</b> by <i>distance</i>
along the specified <i>axis</i> at each of a specified number of <i>frames</i>
(default <b>1</b>). 
If a <i>distance</i> is not given, the length of the <i>axis</i> vector
will be used.  If no models are specified, all 
<a href="../mouse.html#activedef">active</a> models will be translated.
See the

A secondary use is to translate models to the current center of rotation with
<a href="#cofr"><b>move cofr</b></a>.

Keyword options can be used in any order and the keywords can be truncated.

A <b>coordinateSystem</b> for axis definition can be specified
by reference model number <i>N</i>, optionally preceded by #.
Otherwise, the laboratory frame of reference will be used, in which:
 <ul>
 <li>the X-axis is horizontal in the plane of the screen, 
  increasing to the right
 <li>the Y-axis is vertical in the plane of the screen, increasing upward
 <li>the Z-axis is perpendicular to the screen, increasing outward
  (toward the viewer)
 </ul>
The <i>axis</i> can be:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b> - unit vector along the X-axis (1,0,0)
<li><b>y</b> - unit vector along the Y-axis (0,1,0)
<li><b>z</b> - unit vector along the Z-axis (0,0,1)
<li><i>x,y,z</i> (three values separated by commas only) - an arbitrary vector 
</ul>
The <i>distance</i> is in the units of length intrinsic to the data,
usually &Aring;, and can be positive or negative.  
</p><p>
<a name="cofr"></a>
The <b>move cofr</b> command translates one or more models to the 
current center of rotation. 
In this case, the <b>models</b> to move must be specified explicitly.
These are translated as a group to place the center of their 
collective bounding box at the current center of rotation. 
If the movement is to be carried out over multiple <i>frames</i> 
(default <b>1</b>), a <i>distance</i> value must also be supplied, 
but it will be ignored. The <b>move cofr</b> command works best when the
<a href="../sideview.html#rotation">center of rotation method</a>
is <b>fixed</b> or <b>center of view</b>, as other methods will move the
the center of rotation to a different place as the model(s) are moved.

Examples:
<blockquote>
<b>move x -1 25 models #1,2</b>
<br>
<b>move 5,2.5,0 coord #0 mod #0 30</b>
<br>
<b>move cofr mod #3 0 100</b>
</blockquote>
Commands continue to be processed while the requested motion is in progress.
To prevent processing of further commands until the motion is finished, use the
<b><A href="wait.html">wait</A></b> command.
To halt an ongoing <b>move</b>, use <A href="freeze.html"><b>freeze</b></A>.
