<p>
<b>Reset</b> restores models to a default position or one 
previously saved with <a href="savepos.html"><b>savepos</b></a>.
See the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/movie-howto-mar2012/movie_examples
.html#reset"
target="_blank">video mini-example</a>.
Positions can also be restored from the
<a href="../rapid.html"><b>Rapid Access</b></a> interface.

A <i>view_name</i> is specified when a position is saved
with <a href="savepos.html"><b>savepos</b></a>.
A <b><i>position</i></b> includes:
<ul>
<li> the transformations of models
(their rotations and translations relative to input coordinates)
<li> the overall scale
<li> <a href="../clipping.html">clipping plane</a>
status, locations, and orientations
<li> the <a href="../sideview.html#rotation">center of rotation method</a>
<li> the <a href="../sideview.html#fov">horizontal field of view</a>
</ul>
If <i>view_name</i> contains spaces, it must be enclosed
in single or double quotation marks.
If no <i>view_name</i> is given, the name <b>default</b> is used.
Unless changed with <a href="savepos.html"><b>savepos</b></a>,
the <b>default</b> position is one in which the models have not been rotated
or translated.
</p><p>
Saved positions are included in saved 
<a href="../sessions.html#sesdef">Chimera sessions</a>, and
a position named <b>session-start</b> is created automatically
when a session is restored.
</p><p>
<b>Reset</b> restores the named position over the specified number
of image update <i>frames</i> (default <b>1</b>). For <i>frames</i> &gt; 1,
<!--
an interpolation <i>method</i> (default <b>linear</b>) 
-->
a path from the current position to the named position is generated
by interpolation (<a href="#details">details...</a>).  
Whereas <b>reset</b> interpolation considers only a pair of positions
at a time (start and end), the related command 
<a href="fly.html"><b>fly</b></a> can generate a smooth interpolated
path over a series of multiple saved positions.
</p><p>
Depending on the current and named positions,
the camera viewpoint and the transformation of each model could change.
The <b>holdSteady</b> option allows keeping the
viewpoint fixed on a specified model while moving other models to
their transformations relative to that model in the named position.
The movement can apply to all other models (default) or only those 
specified with the <b>moveModels</b> keyword.
</p><p>
Models may have been closed or opened since the position was saved.
How these situations are handled (assuming no <b>holdSteady</b> restriction):
<ul>
<li>If a model that was included in a saved position is no longer present 
when the position is restored, everything else will still be restored.  
<li>If some new model has been opened and assigned the same ID number 
as a model that was closed, the new model (but not any
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/per-model/per-model.html">per-model
clipping plane</a>) will be treated as if it 
were the one included in the saved position.
<li>Otherwise, new models will be transformed to maintain their 
positions relative to the lowest-numbered old model.
</ul>
</p><p>
<b>Reset list</b> lists the names of all saved positions in the
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.

<a name="details">
<b>Interpolation details</b>.</a>
All models with the same relative transformation (rotation and translation) 
between the initial and final positions are grouped together as a rigid unit.
The center of the bounding sphere of the group will move along a straight line
between the initial and final positions, while the group rotates from
the initial orientation to the final orientation about a fixed axis 
(and that center) at a constant angular rate.
