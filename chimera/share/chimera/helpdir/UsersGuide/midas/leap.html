<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<BR><b>leap ( start | stop | position | chopsticks | velocity )</b></h3>
<p>
The <b>leap</b> command controls the mode of interaction between Chimera and
a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/product" target="_blank">Leap Motion
Controller</a>, which uses two cameras to track finger and hand movements.

The <b>leap</b> keywords can be truncated to unique strings:
<ul>
<li><b>start</b> 
- initiate using the device with Chimera
(in <a href="#position">position</a> mode)
<li><b>stop</b>
- stop using the device with Chimera
<li><a name="position"><b>position</b></a>
- use position mode, in which the Chimera contents move as the user's hand moves
(rotations are multiplied by a factor of 3); see <a

<!-- shows a Chimera2 development version -->
<li><b>chopsticks</b>
- use chopstick mode, in which the Chimera contents move as if grasped
between the user's extended index fingers (with rotations multiplied by
a factor of 3) and zoom according to the separation between the fingers; 
thumbs and other fingers should be curled in
<li><b>velocity</b>
- use velocity mode, in which the Chimera contents move based
on the user's hand position and orientation relative to a 
neutral middle position and orientation
</ul>

<p>
<b>Noise</b>. Diverse types of noise and jitter interfere with motion control.
</p><p>
<b>Lack of sensitivity settings</b>.  Currently, the sensitivity of
the device (the relative scale of finger/hand motion and model motion
in Chimera) cannot be controlled via the <b>leap</b> command.
</p><p>
<b>Velocity mode not very intuitive</b>. 
The velocity mode may be difficult to use effectively.
