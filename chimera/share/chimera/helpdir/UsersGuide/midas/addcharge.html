<b>Addcharge</b> is the command-line implementation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add 
Charge</b></a>. It assigns atomic partial charges and Amber/GAFF atom types
as the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attributes</a>
<b>charge</b> and <b>gaffType</b>, respectively. 
Atomic partial charges are included in saved
<a href="../savemodel.html#mol2">Mol2 files</a>.
The charges and Amber/GAFF atom types are used by other Chimera tools such as
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/minimize/minimize.html"><b>Minimize 
Structure</b></a>.
</p><p>
Charge assignment requires explicit hydrogens, 
which can be added beforehand with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
(or the command <a href="addh.html"><b>addh</b></a>).
Structures often have problems
such as truncated sidechains that can lead to non-integral net charges.
The <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock 
Prep</b></a> tool includes options for fixing such problems 
prior to hydrogen addition and charge assignment.
<ul>
<li>Atoms in <b><i>standard residues</i></b>
(water, standard amino acids, standard nucleic acids,
and a few common variants and capping groups)
are assigned charges and types from
<a href="https://ambermd.org/" target="_blank"><b>Amber</b></a>
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#standard">details</a> for standard residues).
<p>
The keyword <b>std</b> (or <b>s</b>) indicates assignments should only
be made to standard residues.  
If <b>spec</b> is used, the charge assignment will be limited 
to the entire model(s) containing the
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specified</a> atoms.
</p><p>
The keyword <b>chargeModel</b> indicates Amber force field <i>version</i>
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#standard">details</a>):
  <ul>
  <li><b>ff14SB</b> or <b>14SB</b> (default)
  <li><b>ff02pol.r1</b> or <b>02pol.r1</b>
(however, polarizability is not supported by
<a href="minimize.html"><b>minimize</b></a>,
see <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#note">note</a>)
  <li><b>ff03ua</b> or <b>03ua</b>
- treats amino acid sidechain aliphatic hydrogens as if collapsed onto the 
corresponding carbons; these &ldquo;extra&rdquo; hydrogens will be removed
(however, the united-atom approach is not supported by
<a href="minimize.html"><b>minimize</b></a>,
see <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#note2">note</a>)
  <li><b>ff03.r1</b> or <b>03.r1</b>
  <li><b>ff99SB</b> or <b>99SB</b> (deprecated)
  <li><b>ff99bsc0</b> or <b>99bsc0</b> (deprecated)
  </ul>
</p>
<li>Except for <b><i>monatomic ions</i></b>, 
which are simply assigned their net charges, 
atoms in <b><i>nonstandard residues</i></b> are assigned charges and
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/minimize/minimize.html#gafftypes">GAFF 
types</a> determined by
<a href="https://ambermd.org/antechamber/antechamber.html"
target="_blank"><b>Antechamber</b></a>, which is included with Chimera
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#antechamber">details</a> for nonstandard residues).
<p>
The keyword <b>nonstd</b> (or <b>n</b>) 
indicates assignments should only be made to nonstandard residues
containing the <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specified</a>
atoms.  All of these residues must be of the same type
(with the same residue name and containing the same types of atoms
connected in the same way).  The <i>net-charge</i> for that type
of residue must also be supplied; it can be zero, or a positive or negative
integer.  The charge calculation
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#antechamber-method"><b>method</b></a> 
can be <b>am1-bcc</b> (default, synonym <b>am1</b>) or <b>gasteiger</b> 
(synonym <b>gas</b>).
</p>
<li>The keyword <b>all</b> (or <b>a</b>, or the absence of arguments)
indicates charges should be assigned to both standard and nonstandard
residues.  
If atoms are <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specified</a>,
the charge assignment will be limited to the entire model(s)
containing the specified atoms.  If nonstandard residues are found,
a dialog for specifying their net charges will appear. 
The <b>chargeModel</b> for standard residues and charge calculation
<b>method</b> for nonstandard residues can be specified as described above.
</ul>
Explicit hydrogens are required for adding charges.
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
will be called as needed to add hydrogens.
<p>
If a nucleic acid chain has a 5' terminal phosphate,
the user will be asked whether this group should be deleted;
otherwise, its atoms will be assigned charges of zero
(the Amber charge set lacks parameters for 5' phosphates).
</p><p>
Unrecognized atom names and non-integral net charges are reported in the 
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>; 
such problems should be examined and
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#resolved">resolved</a>. 
Note that chain-terminal nucleotide residues will normally
have non-integral charges, but the 5' and 3' charges sum to an integer.
