<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>namesel</b> [ <i>name</i> ]</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>~namesel</b> &nbsp;<i>name</i></h3>
<p>
The <b>namesel</b> command saves the current 
<a href="../selection.html">selection</a> with the specified <i>name</i>.
Omitting <i>name</i> indicates
listing the names of previously saved selections in the 
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
The command <b>~namesel</b> &ldquo;forgets&rdquo; an existing named selection.
</p><p>
A <b><i>named selection</i></b> refers to the contents of a selection,
not the process by which the selection was generated.
For example, if a selection of all oxygens in a particular structure is 
saved, retrieving that named selection when <i>different</i> structures 
are present will not select their oxygens.
See <b><A href="alias.html">alias</A></b> instead
for making command-line equivalents of long
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom specification</a> 
strings and/or commands.
</p><p>
Named selections can be restored (as well as saved) using the 
<a href="../menu.html#menuselect"><b>Select</b> menu</a>
or <a href="../rapid.html"><b>Rapid Access</b></a> interface,
and their names can be used for command-line
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom specification</a>.
