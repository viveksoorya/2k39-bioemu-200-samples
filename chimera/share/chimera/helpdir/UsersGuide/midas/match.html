The <b>match</b> command performs least-squares fitting of specified atoms,
moving the first set of atoms (<a href="#move">by default</a>,
the entire models containing them) onto the second.
It can also report least-squares-fit root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) 
without actually performing the fits, <i>i.e.</i>, without moving the atoms.
The related command <a href="rmsd.html"><b>rmsd</b></a> calculates RMSDs
without any fitting, using the current positions of atoms.

<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>Atom-spec1</i></a> and
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a>
must specify equal numbers of atoms.
<a href="#options"><i>Options</i></a> may precede and/or follow
the atom specifications.
</p><p>
Atoms are paired in the order specified,
<i>i.e.</i>, the first atom in the first specification 
is matched to the first atom in the second specification, 
the second atom to the second atom, and so on.
At least three pairs of atoms are needed to define a unique transformation, 
although fewer pairs can be used.
If atom order is not specified, for example,
<blockquote>
<b>match #1:fad #0:fad</b>
<!-- example structures 1f3p and 1lvl -->
<br>
<b>match #2:246,295 #0:195,221</b>
<!-- example structures 4enl #2 and 2mnr #0 -->
</blockquote>
the atoms within a residue are ordered first by name,
and where these are identical, by alternate location identifier, and where
these are also identical, by serial number.
</p><p>
The two sets of atoms can be specified collectively
as a <a href="../selection.html">selection</a>
using the word <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b>.
An ordered selection can be created by
<a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picking</a> atoms one by one, 
first the atoms of the first set, then those of the second in the
corresponding order.
</p><p>
The fit can be <a href="#iterate">iterated</a>.
The number of atom pairs in the final fit and their RMSD are reported in the 
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
The <a href="#showMatrix">transformation matrix</a> can also be reported.

<a name="options">
<h4>Options</h4>
</a><p>
A vertical bar &ldquo;|&rdquo; designates mutually exclusive options, 
of which the default values are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<a name="iterate"><b>iterate</b> <i>cutoff</i></a>
<br>
Perform successive rounds of matching to the indicated stringency
(default is no iteration).
In each cycle of iteration, atom pairs are removed from the match list 
and the remaining pairs are fitted, until no matched pair is more than 
<i>cutoff</i> &Aring; apart.
The atom pairs removed are either the 10% farthest apart of all pairs
or the 50% farthest apart of all pairs exceeding the cutoff, whichever
is the lesser number of pairs.
This excludes conformationally dissimilar regions from the final fit
and allows the best-matching regions to be well superimposed.

Whether to move atoms as a result of the fitting calculation,
and if so, whether to move the entire molecule models containing 
the atoms in <a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec1</i></a>

only the <b>chains</b> containing them, 
only the <b>residues</b> containing them,
only the <b>atoms</b> themselves, or a different set of atoms
(<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec3</i></a>).
If <b>false</b>, no atoms will be moved, but the reported RMSD and 
<a href="#showMatrix">matrix</a> 
will still reflect the movement that would have occurred.
<p>
** Movements of <b>chains</b>, <b>residues</b>, <b>atoms</b>, or

If the model was previously moved relative to the reference coordinate
system (before the current command), matrices for both the change in position 
from the current command and the overall change in position relative
to the reference since file opening will be reported.
