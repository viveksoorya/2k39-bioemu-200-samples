<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:

<p>
The <b>adjust</b> command can be used to change 
a bond angle (valence angle) or bond length.  See also:
<b><A href="angle.html">angle</A></b>,
<b><A href="bond.html">bond</A></b>,
<a href="rotation.html"><b>rotation</b></a>,
<A href="../../ContributedSoftware/editing/editing.html#bond"><b>Adjust 
Bonds</b></a>,
<A href="../../ContributedSoftware/editing/editing.html#bondangle"><b>Adjust 
Bond Angles</b></a>
</p><p>
Keywords can be truncated to unique strings
and their case does not matter.
An <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
indicates all bonds with both endpoints included.  
</p><p>
Only one bond angle
(keyword <b>angle</b>, synonyms <b>bangle</b> and <b>bondangle</b>)
can be changed at a time, so exactly two bonds with one atom in common 
must be specified. The <i>new-angle</i> is given in degrees.
The first bond specified defines which set of atoms should move as the 
valence angle is changed.
</p><p>
Any number of bond lengths 
(keyword <b>length</b>, synonyms <b>blength</b> and <b>bondlength</b>)
can be changed in a single command to the same <i>new-length</i> in &Aring;.
The <b>movingSide</b> option indicates which set of atoms should move as
the length of a bond is changed (default <b>smaller</b>).

<h3>Technical Note</h3>
<p>
If a bond angle is changed by some means other than <b>adjust</b>
(such as <a href="mcopy.html"><b>mcopy</b></a>), the cached value
and subsequent changes with <b>adjust</b> may be incorrect.
The solution is to clear the cache before resuming use of <b>adjust</b>,
with Python:
</p>
<blockquote>
import BuildStructure
<br>
BuildStructure._bondAngleCache = {}
</blockquote>
