<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>mask</b> &nbsp;<i>volume-model</i> &nbsp;<i>surf-models</i>
&nbsp;<a href="#options"><i>options</i></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>mask</b> command extracts a 
<a href="../filetypes.html#volume">volume data</a>
subregion bounded by surfaces (<a href="#algorithm">details...</a>).
All kinds of <a href="../surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface models</a>
can be used, but not surfaces in <a href="../vrmlattrib.html">VRML models</a>.
A new data set with values of zero in the masked-out areas
will be generated, and can be saved to a file using 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
or the command <a href="volume.html"><b>volume</b></a>.

<i>Volume-model</i> can be the model number (preceded by #)
of the input volume data set, or the word <b>ones</b> to indicate
a map with all values set to 1.
The <a href="#spacing"><b>spacing</b></a>
and <a href="#border"><b>border</b></a> options only apply
when the volume data is specified as <b>ones</b>.

<i>Surf-models</i> specifies the bounding surface(s) 
and can be one or more comma-separated model numbers (preceded by #) 
or the word <b>sel</b> to indicate the currently

<a href="../surfattrib.html#surfpiecedef">surface pieces</a>.

<h4>Options</h4>
</a>
Option keywords for <b>mask</b>
can be truncated to unique strings, and their case does not matter.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
A vertical bar &ldquo;|&rdquo; designates mutually exclusive options, and
default settings are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
<blockquote>
  <a name="axis">
  <b>axis</b> &nbsp;<i>x,y,z</i></a>
  <br>Projection axis vector (default is along the data Y axis: <b>0,1,0</b>).
  This is relevant when the surfaces have holes.
  The region between surface layers is computed along the specified axis 
  (see <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a>).  Vector coordinates 
  <i>x,y,z</i> are relative to the untransformed data. 
  The vector can point in any direction 
  (need not be parallel to the X, Y, or Z axis) 
  and need not be of unit length.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="fullmap">
  <b>fullmap</b> &nbsp;true&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>false</b></a>
  <br>
  Make the masked volume data set have the same dimensions as the original 
  volume data set. The full size of the original volume data set is used
  even if only a subregion is being displayed.
  Otherwise, the bounds will be set as small as possible
  to enclose the surfaces, and the masked volume may be smaller.
  If the input volume is specified as <b>ones</b> (which has no defined
  dimensions), the <a href="#border"><b>border</b></a> option applies instead.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="pad"><b>pad</b> &nbsp;<i>distance</i></a>
  <br>Before computing the masked volume, move the surface by the specified
  <i>distance</i> along the surface normals. 
  The units of length are the same as for the data (generally &Aring; or nm),
  and positive or negative values can be used. This allows extracting 
  a larger or smaller region than is enclosed by the original surface.
  Known problem: if the resulting surface intersects itself, 
  the masked volume will not include the intersection. 
  For larger-region extraction, the problem can be avoided 
  by using <a href="#extend"><b>extend</b></a> instead.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="extend"><b>extend</b> &nbsp;<i>N</i></a>
  <br>Before computing the masked volume, move the surface outward by 
  <i>N</i> voxels, where <i>N</i> is a positive integer.
  In other words, include grid points that are within <i>N</i> grid units 
  (along the grid X, Y, and Z axes) of the original surface. 
  Unlike <a href="#pad"><b>pad</b></a>,
  this option correctly handles self-intersections of the expanded surface.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="slab">
  <b>slab</b> &nbsp;<i>width</i>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<i>d1,d2</i></a>
  <br>Extract a slab of data around a surface layer.  Two additional
  surfaces, displaced as specified from the existing surface and joined at 
  their edges (if any), are computed but not displayed.  Data for voxels
  between the computed surfaces are retained.  If a single value
  (<i>width</i>) is supplied, the two computed surfaces are offset
  along the normals of the original surface by &plusmn;&frac12;(<i>width</i>).
  Alternatively, two values separated by a comma but no spaces can be used
  to specify the offsets of the two surfaces independently.
  Positive or negative values can be used, and the units of length
  are the same as for the data (generally &Aring; or nm).
  The basic <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a> applies, except that
  the original surface is replaced by the pair of computed surfaces.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="sandwich">
  <b>sandwich</b> &nbsp;<b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false</a>
  <br>Include only volume voxels lying between two surface layers. Otherwise,
  the volume projected along the axis beyond a single surface layer will also
  be included (see <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="fillOverlap">
  <b>fillOverlap</b> true | <b>false</b></a>
  <br>When multiple surface pieces are specified, retain the union
  of the values from masking to each piece separately.
  For example, if two surface pieces are concentric spheres,
  <b>fillOverlap</b> true will return values for all grid points within 
  the larger sphere, whereas <b>fillOverlap</b> false will return values for
  only those points in the shell between the two surfaces.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="invertMask">
  <b>invertMask</b> true | <b>false</b></a>
  <br>Include the opposite data, the spatial complement of what would
  otherwise be included.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="spacing">
  <b>spacing</b> &nbsp;<i>S</i>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<i>Sx,Sy,Sz</i></a>
  <br>
  Grid spacing for the output map
  when the input volume is specified as <b>ones</b>
  (default 1% of the maximum of the X, Y, and Z dimensions
  of the bounding surfaces);
  otherwise, the spacing will be the same as for the input map.
  The spacing is specified in units of length, typically &Aring;.
  If a single number is supplied, it is
  used in all three directions; if three numbers are supplied
  (separated by commas but not spaces), they
  are used in the X, Y, and Z directions, respectively.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="border">
  <b>border</b> &nbsp;<i>B</i></a>
  <br>
  How far out from the bounding surfaces in all six directions
  (&plusmn;X, &plusmn;Y, &plusmn;Z) to place the edge of the output map
  when the input volume is specified as <b>ones</b>;
  otherwise, the bounds will be set as described for the
  <a href="#fullmap"><b>fullmap</b></a> option.
  The border distance <i>B</i> is specified in units of length, 
  typically &Aring; (default <b>0.0</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="modelId"><b>modelId</b> &nbsp;<i>N</i></a>
  <br>Open the new volume as model number N 
  (an integer, optionally preceded by #).
  Submodel specifications #N.N (# required) can also be given.
  The default is the lowest unused number.
</blockquote>

<a name="algorithm">
<h4>
Mask Algorithm
</h4></a>
<p>
The masked volume is computed by finding where lines
parallel to the <a href="#axis">projection axis</a> intersect the surfaces.  
For a given line, the volume data between the 1st and 2nd,
3rd and 4th, 5th and 6th, ... points of intersection are included 
in the masked volume,
while those between the 2nd and 3rd, 4th and 5th, ... are excluded
(unless multiple surface pieces are used and
<a href="#fillOverlap"><b>fillOverlap</b></a> is set to true).  
The calculation uses a set of parallel lines that pass through points 
on a rectangular grid perpendicular to the projection axis.
If the projection is along a data axis (data X, Y, or Z), the 
lines will pass through the grid points of the data; otherwise,
lines along the projection axis with spacing equal to the minimum 
grid plane spacing of the data will be used.
For each volume voxel, the
intersections of the closest grid line are used to determine inclusion in the
masked volume.  If there is an odd number of intersections, then
points beyond the final one are included in the masked volume unless
the <a href="#sandwich"><b>sandwich</b></a> option is used.  
In the new data set, values outside the masked region are set to zero
and those inside are set to the original volume values.
The grid points of the calculated volume align exactly with those of
the original volume.
By default, the bounds are set to minimally enclose the surfaces
(but see the <a href="#fullmap"><b>fullmap</b></a> and
<a href="#border"><b>border</b></a> options).
The full size of the original volume data set is used
even if only a subregion is being displayed.
