<p>
<b>Mmaker</b> (or <b>matchmaker</b>) is the command-line implementation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/matchmaker/matchmaker.html">
<b>MatchMaker</b></a>, which superimposes structures by first creating 
a pairwise sequence alignment, then fitting the aligned residue pairs.
Residue types and/or secondary structure information
can be used to align the sequences.
<a name="matchatom">
Fitting uses one point per residue:  CA in
amino acid residues and C4' in nucleic acid residues.
If a nucleic acid residue lacks a C4' atom 
(some lower-resolution structures are P traces), 
its P atom will be paired with the P atom of the aligned residue.
</a>
</p><p>
Note: if it is already known which residue numbers in one structure
should be paired with which residue numbers in the other,
another possibility is to use the <a href="match.html"><b>match</b></a>
command, which executes more quickly
because it does not include a sequence alignment step.
See <a href="../superposition.html">superimposing structures</a> 
for a discussion of the different methods available in Chimera.
</p><p>
A reference structure (<i>refstruct</i>)
and a structure to match (<i>matchstruct</i>) must be
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specified</a>.
<i>Matchstruct</i> can include multiple models to be
matched to <i>refstruct</i> independently, but cannot
include parts of the same model as <i>refstruct</i>.
The <a href="#pairing"><b>pairing</b> mode</a> determines
whether chains or models should be specified.
If a <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specification</a>
includes any spaces, it must be enclosed in single or double quote marks.
On occasion, it may be useful to <a href="#restrict">restrict</a>
the calculation to certain residues.
</p><p>
Sequence alignment scores,
parameter values, and final match RMSDs are reported in the
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
If the fit is <a href="#iterate">iterated</a>,
the final RMSD over all residue pairs (columns in the sequence alignment) 
will be reported along with the RMSD over the pruned set of pairs.
</p><p>
<a name="examples">Examples</a>:
<blockquote>
<b>mm #0 #1 show true</b>
</blockquote>
&ndash; superimpose model 1 onto model 0 using default settings;
<a href="#show">show</a> the sequence alignment.
Default settings are to recalculate secondary structure assignments 
with <a href="ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>, generate sequence alignments
using the Needleman-Wunsch <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a>
with the BLOSUM-62 <a href="#matrix">residue similarity matrix</a>
(weight 0.7) and 
<a href="#ssFraction">secondary structure scoring</a> (weight 0.3),
keep the sequence alignment for the <a href="#pairing">best-scoring pair</a>
of chains (one from model 0 and one from model 1), and using that alignment,
<a href="#iterate">iteratively fit</a> the structures with a
cutoff of 2.0 &Aring;.
<blockquote>
<b>mm #0 #1-5 computeSS false</b>
</blockquote>
&ndash; independently superimpose models 1-5 onto model 0 using 
default settings, except without <a href="#computeSS">recalculating</a> 
secondary structure assignments.
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
(example structures: mouse and human phosphoserine phosphatases 
<b>1j97</b>, <b>1nnl</b> open as models 0 and 1, respectively)
<br>
&ndash; align chain A in model 0 with the 
<a href="#pairing">highest-scoring chain</a> in model 1 using
the Smith-Waterman <a href="#algorithm">algorithm</a>
with the PAM-150 <a href="#matrix">residue similarity matrix</a>
(weight 1.0, no <a href="#ssFraction">secondary structure scoring</a>);

the structures using a cutoff of 5.0 &Aring;.
<blockquote>
<b>mm #0:.a:.b #1:.c:.d pair ss show true</b>
</blockquote>
(example structures: insulin <b>1b17</b>, <b>1ben</b> 
open as models 0 and 1, respectively)
<br>
&ndash; align the <a href="#pairing">specific chain pairs</a>
A/C and B/D (in models 0/1) using default settings;
<a href="#show">show</a> both sequence alignments.
<p>
<a name="restrict">
Including specific residues in the
<i>refstruct</i> and/or <i>matchstruct</i> specifications restricts the
calculation to only those residues.
</a>
In general, restriction should only be used in specific cases
to suppress results that would otherwise be obtained.
For example, two chains that would
otherwise align on their N-terminal domains can be forced to align on
their C-terminal domains by specifying only the residues in
the C-terminal domains.  Otherwise, restriction is not recommended,
because full-length alignments tend to be of higher quality, and
<a href="#iterate">iteration</a> already serves to exclude
poorly superimposed regions from the final fit.
Although the unused parts of matched chains will appear in the resulting
sequence alignment (if <a href="#show">shown</a>), they have simply
been added back in as &ldquo;filler,&rdquo; without consideration of
how the characters align, after alignment and matching of only the
specified residues.

<h4>Options</h4>
</a><p>
Option keywords for <b>mmaker</b> (<b>matchmaker</b>) 
can be truncated to unique strings and their case does not matter.
A vertical bar &ldquo;|&rdquo; designates mutually exclusive options, 
and default values are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
Many of the options affect <a href="#scoring">alignment scoring</a>.

<blockquote>
    <a name="pairing"><b>pairing</b> <i>mode</i></a>
    <br>The <i>mode</i> controls which chain sequences are used 
    to construct the reference-match alignment:
    <ul>
    <li><b>bb</b> (default) - use the pair of chains,
     one from the reference model and one from the match model, 
     with the highest alignment score;
    <i>refstruct</i> and <i>matchstruct</i> should each specify a model or
     part of a model
    <li><b>sb</b> - pair a specific chain in the reference model with whichever
    chain in the match model gives the highest alignment score;
    <i>refstruct</i> should specify a chain, <i>matchstruct</i> a model or
     part of a model
    <li><b>ss</b> - pair specific chain(s) in the reference model with
    specific chain(s) in the match model; <i>refstruct</i> and
    <i>matchstruct</i> should specify equal numbers of chains
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="algorithm"><b>alg</b> <i>alignment-algorithm</i></a>
    <br>The <i>alignment-algorithm</i> can be:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>nw</b> (or <b>needle</b>; default) - Needleman-Wunsch, global
    <li> <b>sw</b> (or <b>smith</b>) - Smith-Waterman, local
    </ul>

<blockquote>
  <a name="show"><b>showAlignment</b> true&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>false</b></a>
    <br>Whether to show the resulting sequence alignment(s) with
    <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/framemav.html"
    target="_top"><b>Multalign Viewer</b></a>.
    When <a href="#iterate">fit iteration</a> is employed,
    the pairs used in the final fit will be shown in the alignment as a 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/multalignviewer.html#regions">region</a> 
   named <b>matched residues</b>. The &ldquo;<b>RMSD: ca</b>&rdquo; 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/multalignviewer.html#headers">header</a>
  is automatically shown above the sequences, with histogram bar heights
  representing the <a href="#matchatom">single-point</a>
  spatial variation among residues associated with a column.
  In the pairwise case, the value per column is simply the distance between
  the two associated residues.
  <p>
*When the fit has been <a href="#restrict">restricted</a> to specified residues,
the remaining residues of matched chains will still appear in the alignment,
but merely as a convenient compact representation; how they are aligned
is not meaningful.
  </p><p>
  **These sequence alignments can be considered a by-product of superposition.
  Successful superposition only requires the sequence alignment to be partly
  correct, as incorrect portions tend to be excluded from the fit during
  <a href="#iterate">iteration</a>.
  If the sequences are easy to align (highly similar),
  the sequence alignment is likely to be correct throughout.
  However, if the sequences are more distantly related,
  parts of the alignment may be incorrect even when a successful
  superposition is produced. When <b>matchmaker</b> is used 
  simply to superimpose structures, this is not important.  However, if
  one also wants a corresponding sequence alignment,
  generating a structure-based alignment (after superposition) with
  <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/matchalign/matchalign.html"><b>Match 
  -> Align</b></a> is recommended, especially if the sequences are dissimilar.
  The structure-based sequence alignment will provide better
  statistics for describing structural similarity (RMSD, <i>etc.</i>)
  because more columns will be aligned correctly.

<blockquote>
  <a name="iterate"><b>iterate</b> <i>cutoff</i>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false</a>
  <br>Whether to iteratively fit the structures, and the cutoff for
   excluding residue pairs from the fit. An iterative fit
   will be performed unless this option is set to <b>false</b>.
   The sequence alignment is not changed, but residue pairs in the 
   alignment can be removed from the "match list" used to 
   superimpose the structures. In each cycle,
   pairs of <a href="#matchatom">atoms</a>
   are removed from the match list and the remaining
   pairs are fitted, until no matched pair is
   more than <i>cutoff</i> &Aring; apart (<b>2.0</b> by default).
The atom pairs removed are either the 10% farthest apart of all pairs
or the 50% farthest apart of all pairs exceeding the cutoff, whichever
is the lesser number of pairs.
The result is that the best-matching "core" regions are maximally
superimposed; conformationally dissimilar regions such as flexible
loops are not included in the final fit, even though they may be aligned
in the sequence alignment.
