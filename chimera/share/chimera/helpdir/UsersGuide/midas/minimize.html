 <BR><b>minimize</b> &nbsp;<a href="#options"><i>options</i></a></h3>
<p>
<b>Minimize</b> is the command-line implementation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/minimize/minimize.html">
<b>Minimize Structure</b></a>; it energy-minimizes
molecule models, optionally holding some atoms fixed.
Minimization routines are provided by 
<a href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/MMTK/" target="_blank">MMTK</a>,
which is included with Chimera.
<a href="https://ambermd.org/" target="_blank"><b>Amber</b></a>
parameters are used for standard residues, and Amber's
<a href="https://ambermd.org/antechamber/antechamber.html"
target="_blank"><b>Antechamber</b></a> module (included with Chimera)
is used to assign parameters to nonstandard residues.
</p><p>
Before energy calculations can be performed, it is necessary to correct
structural inconsistencies, add hydrogens, and associate atoms 
with force field parameters.  <b>Minimize</b> calls
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock 
Prep</b></a> to perform
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html#tasks">several
tasks</a> to to prepare the structure(s).
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock 
Prep</b></a> may in turn call other tools
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a> and
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add 
Charge</b></a>).  Currently, 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add 
Charge</b></a> (or the command <a href="addcharge.html"><b>addcharge</b></a>)
must be run prior to minimization because it plays a crucial role in assigning
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/minimize/minimize.html#parameters">parameters</a>.
</p><p>
<b><i>Steepest descent</i></b> minimization
is performed first to relieve highly unfavorable clashes, followed by
<b><i>conjugate gradient</i></b> minimization,
which is much slower but more effective at reaching an energy minimum
after severe clashes have been relieved.
Energies (kJ/mol) are reported in the 
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
**<b>Step numbers reported by MMTK are 2 greater than the actual numbers 
of minimization steps performed</b>. The additional &ldquo;steps&rdquo;
are not minimization steps but operations required to obtain gradient
values and updated coordinates.**

<b>Minimize Structure</b></a> manual page for further details.

<h4>Options</h4>
</a><p>
Option keywords for <b>minimize</b> can be truncated to unique strings
and their case does not matter.
A vertical bar "|" designates mutually exclusive options, and
default values are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <a name="spec"><b>spec</b></a>
  <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
<br>
Minimize/move only the atoms in
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>.
All other atoms will be held in place automatically, without explicit 
use of <a href="#freeze"><b>freeze</b></a>.
However, energy calculations will include the entire
molecule models containing the specified atoms, unless
<a href="#fragment"><b>fragment true</b></a> is also used.
All included models are treated as a single system.
If <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
contains any spaces, it must be enclosed in single or double quote marks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="fragment"><b>fragment</b></a> &nbsp;true&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>false</b>
<br>
Instead of the entire models,
include in energy calculations only the residues containing the
<a href="#spec"><b>spec</b></a> atoms.
Residues can only be included/excluded as a whole,
and all included residues (even if from multiple models)
are treated as a single system.
Note, however, that any subset of the <a href="#spec"><b>spec</b></a> atoms
can be <a href="#freeze">frozen</a> in place.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="cache"><b>cache</b></a> &nbsp;<b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
<br>
Whether to cache parameters such as partial charges for the current system
(models or <a href="#fragment">fragment</a> to be included
in energy calculations).
Caching allows reusing the data in subsequent rounds of 
minimization after simply updating the coordinates. 
Cached data for a system will be kept indefinitely unless Chimera 
detects a change in that system (atom addition or deletion);
setting <b>cache false</b> helps to prevent overconsumption of memory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="prep"><b>prep</b></a> &nbsp;<b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
<br>
Whether to call
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock 
Prep</b></a> when parameters for the current system 
are not in the <a href="#cache">cache</a>.
(If the parameters for the system are in the cache,
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock 
Prep</b></a> will not be called, regardless of this setting.)
The purpose of <b>prep false</b> is to avoid re-preparing structures
that have already been prepared but not cached
(for example, a different <a href="#fragment">fragment</a> than was
previously minimized).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <a name="freeze"><b>freeze</b></a>
&nbsp;<b>none</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;selected&nbsp;|&nbsp;unselected&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
   <br>
Which atoms (in addition to those <a href="#spec">frozen automatically</b></a>)
to hold in place during minimization: none (default),
those which are <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>, those which
are not selected, or those indicated with an
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>.
Previously this option was required to freeze any atoms,
but now that atoms other than the <a href="#spec"><b>spec</b></a> atoms
are frozen automatically, this option is only needed in the case of:
<ol>
<li>restricting the calculation to certain residues with
the <a href="#spec"><b>spec</b></a> option and 
<a href="#fragment"><b>fragment true</b></a>
<li>additionally freezing some of the <a href="#spec"><b>spec</b></a> atoms
</ol>
This combination of options is useful for preventing long or distorted 
bonds at the junction between included and excluded residues.  
For example, minimizing a linker between two domains that are excluded 
from the calculation could significantly degrade the linker-domain bonds 
(since those bonds are ignored) unless the linker endpoint atoms 
are frozen in addition to the domains.

<blockquote>
  <b>nsteps</b> <i>N</i>
    <br><i>N</i> (default <b>100</b>) is the 
number of steps of steepest descent minimization to perform before
any conjugate gradient minimization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>stepsize</b> <i>S</i>
    <br><i>S</i> (default <b>0.02</b> &Aring;) is the
initial step length for steepest descent minimization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>cgsteps</b> <i>M</i>
    <br><i>M</i> (default <b>10</b>) is the 
number of steps of conjugate gradient minimization to perform after
finishing any steepest descent minimization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>cgstepsize</b> <i>D</i>
    <br><i>D</i> (default <b>0.02</b> &Aring;) is the
initial step length for conjugate gradient minimization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>interval</b> <i>I</i>
    <br><i>I</i> (default <b>10</b>) is how often to update the display,
    in terms of minimization steps.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>nogui</b> &nbsp;true&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>false</b>
    <br>Setting <b>nogui</b> to <b>true</b>
     suppresses the appearance of tool dialogs that might otherwise appear.
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock 
Prep</b></a> and 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
are executed with their default settings (as shown when running <b>minimize</b>
with <b>nogui false</b>), while
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add 
Charge</b></a> uses Amber <b>ff14SB</b> charges for standard residues
(<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#standard">details</a>)
and for any nonstandard residues, the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addcharge/addcharge.html#antechamber-method">method</a> 
last specified in its GUI (<b>AM1-BCC</b> if the GUI has not been used).
