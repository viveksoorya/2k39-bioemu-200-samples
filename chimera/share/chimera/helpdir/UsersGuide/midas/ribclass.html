<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <br><b>ribclass</b> &nbsp;<i>class-name</i>&nbsp;
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a></h3>
<p>
<b>Ribclass</b> sets
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">residue
class</a>:
which atoms in a residue control
<a href="../representation.html#ribbon">ribbon</a> path
and which are considered part of the backbone. 
The <i>class-name</i> can be <b>none</b>, indicating default behavior,
or the name of a 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">residue
class</a> previously created and named with 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html"><b>Ribbon
Style Editor</b></a>. The default behavior is to use the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">built-in
residue class</a> most appropriate for a given residue,
based on the atoms it contains.
Residue class names containing spaces should be enclosed in single or double 
quote marks, for example:
<blockquote>
<b>ribclass "beta peptide" :1-8.b</b>
</blockquote>
Residues with any atoms in 
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a> 
will be affected.
</p><p>
The command <b><A href="ribspline.html">ribspline</A></b>
sets how ribbon path is calculated from atom positions.
Backbone atoms are hidden when ribbon is shown
unless <b><A href="ribbackbone.html">ribbackbone</A></b> is used.
