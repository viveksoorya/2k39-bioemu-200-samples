<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>rmsd</b>
&nbsp;<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec1</i></a>
&nbsp;<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a></h3>
<p>
The <b>rmsd</b> command evaluates the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) between specified sets of atoms, without any fitting.
The related command <a href="match.html"><b>match</b></a> 
performs least-squares fitting.  See also:
<a href="../superposition.html">superimposing structures</a>
</p><p>
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>Atom-spec1</i></a> and
<a href="atom_spec.html#basic"><i>atom-spec2</i></a>
must specify equal numbers of atoms.
</p><p>
Atoms are paired in the order specified,
<i>i.e.</i>, the first atom in the first specification
is matched to the first atom in the second specification,
the second atom to the second atom, and so on.
If atom order is not specified, for example,
<blockquote>
<b>rmsd #1:fad #0:fad</b>
<!-- example structures 1f3p and 1lvl -->
<br>
<b>rmsd #2:246,295 #0:195,221</b>
<!-- example structures 4enl #2 and 2mnr #0 -->
</blockquote>
the atoms within a residue are ordered first by name,
and where these are identical, by alternate location identifier, and where
these are also identical, by serial number.
</p><p>
The two sets of atoms can be specified collectively
as a <a href="../selection.html">selection</a>
using the word <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b>.
An ordered selection can be created by
<a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picking</a> atoms one by one,
first the atoms of the first set, then those of the second in the
corresponding order.
