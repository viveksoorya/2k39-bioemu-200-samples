<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<BR><b>runscript</b> &nbsp;<i>script</i> &nbsp;<i>script-arguments</i></h3>
<p>
<b>Runscript</b> allows executing a Python script with command-line arguments
from within Chimera.  The script file is specified by <i>script</i>,
either a pathname to open the file directly
or the word <b>browse</b> or <b>browser</b> to elicit a 
<a href="../opensave.html">dialog</a> for opening the file.
The script runs in Chimera's current directory, which can be changed 
with the command <a href="cd.html"><b>cd</b></a>
(other files referenced in the script or its arguments can be specified by 
pathnames relative to that location or by absolute pathnames).
Arguments that include spaces must be
enclosed by quotes, but quotes should not be nested, with the exception
that single quotes can appear inside a double-quoted string and double
quotes can appear inside a single-quoted string.
</p><p>
The <b>chimera</b> module is pre-imported into the script's
global namespace, and the arguments are made into a tuple variable in the 
global namespace called "arguments" containing however many
strings were supplied.  
The arguments are also available in the standard sys.argv location.
</p><p>
The command <b><A href="open.html">open</A></b> can also execute 
Python scripts, but it does not include a way of supplying 
command-line arguments.
