<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<br><b>angle</b> &nbsp;<i>atom1</i> &nbsp;<i>atom2</i> &nbsp;<i>atom3</i> 
&nbsp;[&nbsp;<i>atom4</i>&nbsp;[&nbsp;dihedral&nbsp;true&nbsp;|&nbsp;false&nbsp;]]</h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
<br><b>angle</b> &nbsp;<i>object1</i> &nbsp;<i>object2</i></h3>
<p>
The <b>angle</b> command measures angles:
<ul>
<li>formed by three atoms 
<li>formed by four atoms (dihedral angle,
or if <b>dihedral false</b> is specified, the angle between the 
<i>atom1</i>-<i>atom2</i> and <i>atom3</i>-<i>atom4</i> vectors). The 
<b>dihedral</b> keyword can be truncated, and the option is default <b>true</b>.
Synonyms for true: True, T, t, 1. Synonyms for false: False, F, f, 0.
<li>between two geometric objects (two axes, two planes, or one axis and one
plane) created with <a href="define.html"><b>define</b></a> or
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#axes"><b>Axes/Planes/Centroids</b></a>
</ul>
Any <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom specification</a>
that gives the proper number of atoms can be used.
The order of specification is important, but atoms need not be connected.
Objects are specified by ID as shown in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#objectlist">
<b>Axes/Planes/Centroids</b> table</a>.
For angle measurements, axes and planes are treated as infinite.
The angle value in degrees is reported in the
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> and
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
</p><p>
Three or four atoms can be
specified collectively using the word <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or
<b>picked</b> if the current <a href="../selection.html">selection</a>
contains only those atoms; the
order in which the atoms were <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
(most likely <a href="../selection.html#pickselect">picked</a>) is used.
When order information is lacking
(for example, the atoms were selected simultaneously),
the angle actually measured may not be the one intended.
</p><p>
The <b>angle</b> command provides a static measurement;
changes are not reported automatically.
Angles formed by atoms can be monitored continuously using the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#angles">
<b>Angles/Torsions</b> panel</a>.
