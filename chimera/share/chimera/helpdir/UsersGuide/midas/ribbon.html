<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:

<b>Ribbon</b> shows a <a href="../representation.html#ribbon">ribbon 
representation</a> of proteins and nucleic acids 
(and chains of any other residue types for which a ribbon
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#class">residue 
class</a> has been defined).
<b>~Ribbon</b> hides the ribbon.  Residues with any atoms in 
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a> 
will be affected.  
See the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/movie-howto-mar2012/movie_examples
.html#ribseq"
target="_blank">video mini-example</a>.
</p><p>
Ribbon style can be controlled with 
<b><A href="ribrepr.html">ribrepr</A></b>, 
ribbon scaling (secondary-structure-specific dimensions) with 
<b><A href="ribscale.html">ribscale</A></b>, 
ribbon residue class with <b><A href="ribclass.html">ribclass</A></b>,
and ribbon path method with <b><A href="ribspline.html">ribspline</A></b>.
New styles, scalings, and classes can be created with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html">
<b>Ribbon Style Editor</b></a>.
</p><p>
By default, a residue's
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#mainchain">mainchain atoms</a>
are hidden when its ribbon segment is displayed;
the command <b><A href="ribbackbone.html">ribbackbone</A></b>
enables showing both at the same time.
</p><p>
Protein helix and strand assignments are taken from the input structure
file or generated with <a href="ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>.
For nucleic acids, the ribbon simply follows the phosphodiester backbone. 
</p><p>
Ribbon color is assigned on a per-residue basis
(for example, using 
<a href="rainbow.html"><b>rainbow</b></a>) and may
differ from the apparent color of the residue's atoms; see
<a href="../hierarchy.html">coloring hierarchy</a>.
If ribbon colors have not been assigned, the ribbon
defaults to the model-level color.
