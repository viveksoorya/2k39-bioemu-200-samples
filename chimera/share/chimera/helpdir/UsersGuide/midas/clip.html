<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>clip</b> ( on | off )</h3>
<p>
<b>Clip</b> can be used to move the <b>hither</b> (front) or <b>yon</b> (back)
<a href="../clipping.html#global">global clipping plane</a>
a specified <i>distance</i> from its current position (default), or to a 
target location that is <i>distance</i> away from the center of rotation
(with <b>fromCenter true</b>).
The <i>distance</i> is in physical units of length, usually &Aring;;
positive values are toward the user, negative values away from the user.
The back plane is automatically pushed slightly behind the front plane
(0.01 distance units)
if the specified movement would have reversed their positions.
</p><p>
The <i>frames</i> option specifies a number of image update frames
(default <b>1</b>).  For <i>frames</i> &gt; 1:
 <ul>
 <li>a movement of <i>distance</i> from the current clipping plane position 
  (<b>fromCenter false</b>, default) is repeated at <i>each</i> frame 
 <li>a movement to the target location of <i>distance</i> from the
 center of rotation (<b>fromCenter true</b>) is performed
 gradually over the total number of frames
</ul>

<b>~Clip</b> halts an ongoing clip plane motion.
Commands continue to be processed
while the requested motion is in progress. To pause command processing
until the motion is finished, use the
<b><A href="wait.html">wait</A></b> command.
</p><p>
A second use of <b>clip</b> is to turn 
<a href="../clipping.html#global">global clipping</a> on and off.
Turning it on does not restore previous clipping plane positions.
