<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>rainbow</b> [<i>level</i>]
 [<i>color1</i>,<i>color2</i>, ...]
 &nbsp;<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a></h3>
<p>
The command <b>rainbow</b> colors successive residues, chains, models,
or protein secondary structure elements over a specified color range.  
</p><p>
If <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a> is blank,
every biopolymer chain will be colored, with the color changing per residue.
The default color list is <b>blue</b>, <b>cyan</b>,
<b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, and <b>red</b>, in that order.
Thus, <b>rainbow</b> without any arguments will color the residues in
each chain from blue through the rainbow spectrum to red 
(peptides from N-terminus to C-terminus,
nucleic acids from 5' end to 3' end).
Although a narrower <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">
<i>atom-spec</i></a> may be supplied,
the entire model(s) containing the specified atoms will be affected.
The coloring cannot be limited to a subset of the polymer chains in a model
or to a subset of the residues in a chain except as noted below for the
<i>level</i>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>residue</b> or <b>residues</b> (default)
- assign a different color to each residue, starting over for each chain;
<a href="atom_spec.html#chainassign">water and HET</a>
without chain IDs are ignored
<li><b>chain</b> or <b>chains</b>
- assign a different color to each chain, starting over for each model;
<a href="atom_spec.html#chainassign">water and HET</a>
without chain IDs are ignored
<li><b>model</b> or <b>models</b>
- assign a different color to each model
<li><b>sse</b>
- assign a different color to each protein secondary structure element 
(helix or strand), starting over for each chain;
coil (non-helix, non-strand) and nonproteins are ignored
<li><b>helix</b> or <b>helices</b>
- assign a different color to each protein &alpha;-helix,
starting over for each chain; strand, coil, and nonproteins are ignored
<li><b>strand</b> or <b>strands</b>
- assign a different color to each protein &beta;-strand,
starting over for each chain; helix, coil, and nonproteins are ignored
</ul>
<p>
Two or more color names <i>color1</i>, <i>color2</i>, <i>etc.</i>
can be supplied as a comma-separated list.
Each can be any <a href="color.html#colorname">color name</a>
that specifies a single color, except that R,G,B[,A] tuples cannot be used.
If two names are given, they designate the starting and ending
colors; if more than two names are given, they designate the starting
color, intermediate color(s), and ending color.
The 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/rainbow/rainbow.html"><b>Rainbow</b></a>
tool is a graphical implementation of <b>rainbow</b> in which five
colors are used.
</p><p>
Apparent color is determined by a
<a href="../hierarchy.html">hierarchy</a>;
briefly, atom colors assigned on a per-atom
basis and ribbon colors assigned on a per-residue basis
override the model-level color. 
When coloring per residue or chain,
<b>rainbow</b> sets individual atom colors and per-residue ribbon colors;
when coloring per model, it sets model-level colors and removes 
any atom-level  and ribbon color assignments within the models.
