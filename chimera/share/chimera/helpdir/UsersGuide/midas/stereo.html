<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <br><b>stereo</b> <i>mode</i></h3>
<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>~stereo</b></h3>
<p>
<b>Stereo</b> controls the <a href="../stereo.html#modedef">camera mode</a> 
of the graphics window (<a href="../stereo.html">details...</a>).
The command <b>~stereo</b> restores mono viewing.

</p>
Possible values of <i>mode</i> are listed in <b>bold</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>mono</b> or <b>off</b>, no stereo 
(can also be set with the command <b>~stereo</b>)
<li><b>left-eye</b> (equivalents: <b>left</b>, <b>left eye</b>)
<li><b>right-eye</b> (equivalents: <b>right</b>, <b>right eye</b>)
<li><b>cross-eye</b> (equivalents: <b>cross</b>,
<b>crosseye</b>, <b>cross eye</b>)
<li><b>wall-eye</b> (equivalents: <b>wall</b>,
<b>walleye</b>, <b>wall eye</b>)
<li><b>red-cyan</b> or <b>anaglyph</b>
- overlapping left-eye and right-eye views in different colors, to be viewed
with &ldquo;glasses&rdquo; 
(often inexpensive cardboard/plastic) with colored filters
<li><b>green-magenta</b> or <b>trioscopic</b>
- similar to red-cyan, except with different colors and trade-offs
<li><b>sequential</b> (equivalents: <b>seq</b>, <b>on</b>)
- rapid flickering between left-eye and right-eye views, to be viewed
with special synchronised glasses.  Sequential stereo needs
<a href="https://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/hardware#StereoHardware"
target="_blank">special hardware</a>.
<li><b>reverse sequential</b> 
(equivalents: <b>reverse</b>, <b>rev</b>, <b>reverse seq</b>, <b>rev seq</b>)
- as above, but with the opposite convention for the two views
<li><b>row even</b> (equivalents: <b>row</b>, <b>row interleaved</b>)
- row-interleaved with even rows used for the right-eye view
<li><b>row odd</b> 
- row-interleaved with odd rows used for the right-eye view
<li><b>dome</b> [<b>tilt</b> <i>t-angle</i>] [<b>parallax</b> <i>p-angle</i>]
- angular fisheye of the hemisphere in front of the camera, with
<a href="../sideview.html#fov">horizontal field of view</a>
locked to 90&deg;, optional tilt, and optional parallax:
<blockquote>
When no tilt is specified, the Chimera Z-axis appears at the dome zenith 
(the center of the circular view in the graphics window).  
Setting the dome tilt angle to 60&deg; places the Chimera Z-axis 30&deg;
above the dome horizon, the approximate focus of attention of an audience 
in a planetarium dome with unidirectional seating. In the graphics window,
this means the Z-axis direction is &frac16; of the way from the bottom of the 
circular display.
<p>
Left- and right-eye stereo views for dome display can be generated by
specifying parallax angles of opposite signs.  The views are rotated
by <i>p-angle</i> degrees about the Y (vertical) axis through the center 
of the focal plane. For example, views recorded with dome parallax 
&plusmn;5&deg; can be combined to give a stereo effect when viewed in
the forward (&minus;Z) direction.
</blockquote>
<li><b>truncated dome</b>
- same as the dome mode, except with the bottom of the hemisphere cut off,
and no tilt or parallax options
<li><b>dti</b> (equivalents: <b>DTI</b>, <b>dti side-by-side</b>,
<b>DTI side-by-side</b>) 
</ul>
