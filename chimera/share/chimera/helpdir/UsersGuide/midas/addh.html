<h3><a href="usageconventions.html">Usage</a>:
 <BR><b>addh</b> <a href="#options"><i>options</i></a></h3> 
<p>
<b>Addh</b> adds hydrogens to molecules, as well as
OXT atoms where missing from peptide C-termini.
It is the command-line implementation of
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>.
Chimera uses atom and residue names, or if these are not "standard,"
atomic coordinates, to determine connectivity and
<a href="../idatm.html">atom types</a>;
the atom types are then used to determine the number of hydrogens
to be added and their positions.
The positions of pre-existing atoms are not changed, but
any lone pairs and unidentifiable-element atoms are deleted.
If any atoms cannot be assigned a 
<a href="../idatm.html">type</a>, a dialog will appear.
It is necessary to click on the line for each unassigned
atom and then indicate its
proper substituent geometry and number of substituents.
</p><p>
Added hydrogens will be colored the 
<a href="../colortables.html#byelement">element color</a> (default white)
if the attached atom is colored by element, otherwise to match
the attached atom.
</p><p>
By default, if amino acids have standard residue names,
each histidine sidechain will be protonated based on its local environment,
whereas the sidechains of other residue types will be assigned 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html#states">protonation 
states</a> reasonable at physiological pH, regardless of the local
environment: negative glutamic acid and aspartic acid, 
positive lysine and arginine, and neutral cysteine and tyrosine.
Alternative protonation states of histidine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, 
lysine, and cysteine can be specified with special residue names
in the input coordinate file (see the <a href="#options">options</a>).
To specify the protonation states of individual residues interactively, 
use the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
graphical interface instead of the <b>addh</b> command.
</p><p>
See the <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>
manual page for details including
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html#bondlengths">bond 
lengths</a> and 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/addh/addh.html#radchange">effects 
on radii</a>.

Option keywords for <b>addh</b> can be truncated to unique strings
and their case does not matter.
A vertical bar "|" designates mutually exclusive options, and
default values are indicated with <b>bold</b>.
Synonyms for true: True, 1.  Synonyms for false: False, 0.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <b>spec</b>
  &nbsp;<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
  <br>Whether to restrict hydrogen addition to a subset of
  the open molecule models.  Hydrogens will be added to the 
  entire model(s) containing the specified atoms.  If
  <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top"><i>atom-spec</i></a>
 includes any spaces, it must be enclosed in single or double quote marks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>inIsolation</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Whether hydrogen placement should be affected by atoms within the same
  model only. Otherwise, other models in the vicinity (except submodels of
  the same model) may affect hydrogen placement, regardless of whether they
  were designated for hydrogen addition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>hbond</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Hydrogens are placed based on the <a href="../idatm.html">types</a> 
  of the existing atoms and to avoid clashes;
  this option controls whether H-bond formation should also be considered.
  Considering H-bonds increases the calculation time.
  Even when <b>hbond</b> is <b>true</b>,
  hydrogen positions are not energy-minimized, and
  a globally optimal network in terms of the number of H-bonds or 
  total H-bonding energy is not necessarily found.  
   Both intra- and inter-model hydrogen bonds are considered, including
  interactions with models to which hydrogens are not being added (as in 
  <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html">
  <b>FindHBond</b></a> when the 
  <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/findhbond/findhbond.html#scope">scope</a>
  of the calculation is set to <b>both</b>).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>useHisName</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Whether to use residue names for histidine to determine which 
  sidechain nitrogens should be protonated: the &delta;-nitrogen
  in residues named HID, the &epsilon;-nitrogen in HIE, and both 
  nitrogens in HIP.  Residues named HIS will be 
  treated as unspecified, and may end up with either or both sidechain 
  nitrogens protonated depending on the local environment and 
  whether H-bonds are being considered (whether <b>hbond</b> is <b>true</b>).
  If <b>useHisName</b> is <b>false</b>, 
  all histidine residues will be treated as unspecified regardless of 
  which of the above residue names are used.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>useGluName</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Whether to use residue names for glutamic acid to determine sidechain 
  charge state: GLU negatively charged and GLH neutral (OE2-protonated).
  If <b>false</b>, all glutamic acid sidechains will be made negatively charged
  regardless of which of the above residue names are used.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>useAspName</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Whether to use residue names for aspartic acid to determine sidechain 
  charge state: ASP negatively charged and ASH neutral (OD2-protonated).
  If <b>false</b>, all aspartic acid sidechains will be made negatively charged
  regardless of which of the above residue names are used.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>useLysName</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Whether to use residue names for lysine to determine sidechain 
  charge state: LYS positively charged and LYN neutral.
  If <b>false</b>, all lysine sidechains will be made positively charged
  regardless of which of the above residue names are used.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <b>useCysName</b> <b>true</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;false
  <br>Whether to use residue names for cysteine to determine sidechain 
  charge state: CYS treated as unspecified and CYM negatively charged.
  If <b>false</b>, all cysteine sidechains will be treated as unspecified
  regardless of which of the above residue names are used.
