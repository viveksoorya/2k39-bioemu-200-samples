The <b>distance</b> command measures the distance between two items: 
<ul>
<li>two atoms
<li>two geometric objects created with 
<a href="define.html"><b>define</b></a> or
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#axes"><b>Axes/Planes/Centroids</b></a>
<li>one atom and one geometric object
</ul>
Any <a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specification</a>
that gives the proper number of items can be used,
including the word <b>selected</b>, <b>sel</b>, or <b>picked</b> to
indicate the current <a href="../selection.html">selection</a> of atoms
and/or objects.  Otherwise, objects can be specified by ID as shown in the
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#objectlist"><b>Axes/Planes/Centroids</b> table</a>.
The distance is shown temporarily in the
<a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>
and recorded in the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.

Atom-atom distance measurements are <b><i>monitors</i></b>, meaning that a
<a href="../pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobond</a> is drawn between the
two atoms and the pseudobond's label will automatically update to reflect 
any changes in the distance.  Updates are not sent to the 
<a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>, however.
The
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#distances">
<b>Distances</b></a> tool lists the current distance monitors
and allows setting default distance
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#dist-formatting">formatting</a> and 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#dist-depiction">depiction</a> options.  These settings are stored in a user's
<a href="../preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
</p><p>
An individual distance monitor can be removed by using <b>~distance</b> with 
<a href="frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">specification</a> of the
two atoms involved.
Using <b>~distance</b> without any argument or with the keyword <b>all</b> 
removes all distance monitors.
</p><p>
Other types of distance measurements (atom-object and object-object) are simply
reported in the <a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a> 
in addition to the <a href="../reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>. 
For distance measurements,
axes are treated as finite line segments, while planes are treated as infinite.
For atom-plane and centroid-plane distances only, 
the <b>signed</b> keyword can be supplied to
indicate that distances on opposite sides of the plane should be reported
with opposite signs.
</p><p>
Examples:
<blockquote>
<b>distance :bgc@c1 a4</b>
</blockquote>
- measure the distance between atom C1 in residue BGC and axis a4
<blockquote>
<b>distance c1 c2</b>
</blockquote>
- measure the distance between centroid c1 and centroid c2
<blockquote>
<b>distance signed p2 :313.a@o</b>
</blockquote>
- measure the signed distance between plane p2 
and atom O in residue 313 of chain A
<blockquote>
<b>~distance #1:12@CA #0:47@CA</b>
</blockquote>
- stop monitoring the distance between atom CA of residue 12 in model 1 and 
atom CA of residue 47 in model 0
