<h2>Saving Images</h2>
</a>
<p>
Images can be rendered directly with Chimera or 
<a href="#raytrace">raytraced</a> with POV-Ray
using <b>File... Save Image</b>
or the <b><A href="midas/copy.html">copy</A></b> command.

<a href="export.html">exporting a scene</a>
</p>
The top section of the <b>Save Image</b> dialog contains a file
browser for specifying output location, <b>File name</b>, and
<a name="filetype">
<b>File type</b>.  Formats include:
</a>
<ul>
<li><b>EPS</b> - Encapsulated PostScript
<li><b>JPEG</b> - see <a href="#options">JPEG quality</a>
<li><b>PS</b> - PostScript
<li><b>PNG</b> (default) 
- <a href="#raytrace">raytracing</a> always produces this format
<li><b>PPM</b>
<li><b>TIFF</b> - LZW-compressed
<li><b>TIFF-fast</b> - uncompressed (larger files)
</ul>
<p>
<a name="stereoformats"></a>
When the <a href="#imagemode"><b>Image type</b></a>
is a stereo pair, the possible formats also include:
<ul>
<li><b>Stereo JPEG</b> (*.jps) 
<li><b>Stereo PNG</b> (*.pns)
</ul>
Viewing such files as standard JPEG and PNG shows side-by-side images, 
but special viewers are available to show them as stereo.
Free viewers include
<a href="https://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/index.html" 
target="_blank">StereoPhoto Maker</a> and
<a href="https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/JPSViewer.shtml"
target="_blank">JPSViewer</a>.

Several dialog settings such as the
<a href="#supersampling">supersampling level</a> and
<a href="#resolution">print resolution</a> are saved in the 
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.

  <li><b>Maintain current aspect ratio</b> (default on)
  - whether to constrain the image width/height ratio to match
  the width/height ratio of the
  <a href="chimerawindow.html">graphics window</a>. If so,
  changing the image width automatically adjusts the height and 
  <i>vice versa</i>. If not, image width and height can be changed 
  independently: the <b>Grow to Fit</b> button resizes the graphics window
  to match the image aspect ratio by increasing one window dimension
  (<i>i.e.</i>, width or height),
  while <b>Shrink to Fit</b> resizes the graphics window
  to match the image aspect ratio by decreasing one window dimension.
  If the window has not been grown or shrunk to match the image aspect ratio,
  a saved image will include more than what is displayed.

    Raytracing can be very slow but includes fancier effects such as 
    high-quality shadows. 
    First, POV-Ray input files containing the scene (*.pov)
    and raytracing options (*.ini) are generated, and then
    the raytracing calculation is run as a background job
    that can be monitored or canceled using the
    <a href="../ContributedSoftware/idle/task.html"><b>Task Panel</b></a>.
    The <b>POV-Ray Options</b> button opens the

      how many pixels to sample in the X and Y dimensions for each pixel in
      the final saved image. 1x1 corresponds to no supersampling.
      Higher values increase the smoothness of edges in saved images and 
      increase calculation time with little effect on file size. 
      3x3 is generally recommended when supersampling is done.
      A potential disadvantage of supersampling is that lines
      such as <a href="#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>
      may become unexpectedly thin in the final image because there
      is a system-dependent limit on how wide they can be drawn
      in the initial image. The effective maximum linewidth 
      is reported at the bottom of the dialog. 
      It may be possible to achieve the desired linewidth by reducing

Chimera performs offscreen rendering as permitted by the system.
<a name="exception">Offscreen rendering is not supported by
certain older machines.</a>  On those systems,
the image will be redrawn in the graphics window, piece by piece
depending on the specified <a href="#imagesize">image size</a>

during this process,
the graphics window should not be obscured by other windows or moved 
offscreen, even partially.
</p>

<a name="tips"><h2>Tips on Preparing Images</h2></a>
<p>
The following tips mainly apply to high-quality rendering directly in Chimera.  
Images rendered in Chimera are often clearer and more illustrative than those
made with the (noninteractive) <a href="raytracing.html">raytracing</a> option,
and can even include <a href="#shadows">shadows</a>.
</p><p>
The <a href="frametut.html" target="_top">tutorials</a>
include step-by-step examples of preparing images in Chimera.
Many <a href="representation.html">display styles</a> and
<a href="colortables.html">colors</a> are available. 
</p><p>
<a name="presets"><b>Presets</b></a>
are predefined combinations of display settings.
A preset can be applied by choosing it from the
<a href="menu.html#menupresets"><b>Presets</b> menu</a>
or by using the <a href="midas/preset.html"><b>preset</b></a> command.
Further changes can be made after a preset has been applied.
Types of presets:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>interactive</b> - for interactive viewing in Chimera
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>publication</b> - for making publication/presentation images
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>custom</b> - defined by the user in a script, see the
<a href="preferences.html#Presets"><b>Presets</b> preferences</a>
<br>
Publication presets make the background white, 
increase <a href="#smoothness">smoothness</a>,
and adjust display styles, without changing which items are displayed
or their colors.
See also: <a href="midas/alias.html"><b>alias</b></a>
</p><p>
<a name="bg"><b>Background color</b></a> is set to white by the
publication presets mentioned above, 
but can be set to <a href="colortables.html">any color</a>
with the <a href="coloractions.html"><b>Color Actions</b></a> dialog,
the <a href="midas/background.html"><b>background</b></a> command, or
the <a href="preferences.html#Background"><b>Background</b> preferences</a>.
The latter two can also set the background to a gradient of multiple colors 
or to an image read from a file.
If system hardware permits, images can be saved with a 
<a href="print.html#transback">transparent background</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="silhouettes"><b>Silhouettes</b></a>
are outlines that emphasize borders and discontinuities.
Although shown in the interactive display, these are mainly intended 
for output images, as <a href="#sstip">supersampling</a> 
makes them look much smoother in the image than on the screen.
Whether silhouettes are shown and their linewidth and color can be controlled
with the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a> or
the <a href="midas/set.html"><b>set</b></a> command.
<a href="menu.html#menupresets">Publication presets</a> #1 and #2 turn on 
silhouettes and turn off <a href="#depth">depth cueing</a>.
Silhouettes can also be combined with depth cueing,
as in <a href="menu.html#menupresets">publication preset</a> #5.
This silhouettes setting is global (applies to all models),
but when it is on, the silhouettes for an individual model can be toggled
with the command <a href="midas/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>,
the <a href="inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>,
or the <a href="moleculeattrib.html">molecule model attributes panel</a>.
<blockquote>
If outlines are desired but the silhouettes seem to highlight too many contours,
a trick is to use the <a href="selection.html">selection</a> outline instead,
as it is limited to the perimeters of selected objects.
The selection outline color can be changed, <i>e.g</i> to black, in the 
<a href="preferences.html#Selection"><b>Selection</b> preferences</a>.
Although the linewidth is not adjustable, a thicker line relative to the
selected object(s) can be obtained by resizing the 
<a href="chimerawindow.html">graphics window</a> smaller; a large output image 
can still be obtained by specifying larger dimensions when saving the image.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
<a name="depth">
<b>Depth cueing</b> is progressive shading from front to back,
also known as fog or mist.</a>
It can be controlled
with the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a> or
the <a href="midas/set.html"><b>set</b></a> command.
The depth cueing color tracks the background color by default,
but it can be changed independently with
the <a href="coloractions.html"><b>Color Actions</b></a> dialog,
the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>, or
the <a href="midas/set.html"><b>set</b></a> command.  
<a href="menu.html#menupresets">Publication presets</a> #3 and #4 turn on 
depth cueing and turn off <a href="#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>.
Depth cueing can also be combined with silhouettes,
as in <a href="menu.html#menupresets">publication preset</a> #5.
</p><p>
<a name="lighting"><b>Lighting</b></a>. Chimera lighting modes may include 
ambient (nondirectional) light and up to three directional lights:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>ambient</b> - ambient-only, giving an unshaded, flat appearance
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>single</b> - single directional light + ambient
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>two-point</b> - two directional lights + ambient
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;
<b>three-point</b> - three directional lights + ambient
<br>
A simple, line-drawing-like appearance can be achieved by combining the
ambient-only mode with <a href="menu.html#menupresets">publication preset</a>
#1, #2, or #5 (white background, <a href="#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>).
Lighting mode, brightness, contrast, light directions,
and <a href="sideview.html#shininess">shininess</a> can be controlled 
with the <a href="sideview.html#lighting"><b>Lighting</b> tool</a> and
<a href="midas/lighting.html"><b>lighting</b></a> command.
</p><p>
<a name="smoothness"><b>Smoothness</b></a>
can be increased by increasing the pixel dimensions
of an image (its resolution).  Additionally, independent of resolution:
<ul>
<li><b>Atoms, bonds, ribbons</b>.
<a href="representation.html">Display styles</a> 
other than wire (which is not recommended for publication images)
can be smoothed by raising the <b>subdivision</b> level
with the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a> or
the <a href="midas/set.html"><b>set</b></a> command.
This setting also affects curved <b>geometric objects</b>
defined in <a href="bild.html">BILD format</a>.
The <a href="#presets">publication presets</a> increase 
<b>subdivision</b> to 5.0 if the current value is lower.
<br><br>
<li><b>Surfaces</b>.  The smoothness of a
<a href="representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
can be increased by increasing its <b>vertex density</b>
with the command <a href="midas/setattr.html"><b>setattr</b></a>,
the <a href="inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>, 
or the <a href="msmsattrib.html">molecular surface attributes panel</a>
(see also the <a href="preferences.html#New Surfaces"><b>New Surfaces</b>
preferences</a>). This parameter can also be specified when a
surface is displayed with the <a href="midas/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a>
command. The <a href="#presets">publication presets</a>
raise <b>vertex density</b> to 10.0 for any existing molecular surfaces
with lower values. Separate smoothing options are available in
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/multiscale/framemulti.html" target="_top">
<b>Multiscale Models</b></a> and
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> for the surfaces they create
(see also the command <a href="midas/sop.html#smooth"><b>sop smooth</b></a>).
<br><br>
<li><a name="sstip"><b>Supersampling</b></a>.
The smoothness of edges in saved images can be increased by supersampling,
where Chimera automatically saves an image at higher resolution (larger
pixel dimensions) than requested and then samples it back down 
to the requested final size.  The default level of supersampling, 3x3, is
usually recommended for publication images and gives much smoother edges 
than no supersampling (1x1).  For individual images, the supersampling level
is specified in the <a href="print.html#saveimage"><b>Save Image</b> dialog</a>
or with the <a href="midas/copy.html"><b>copy</b></a>
command's <b>supersample</b> keyword.
The command <a href="midas/movie.html#record-options"><b>movie record</b></a>
and dialogs for <a href="movies.html">recording movies</a>
also include supersampling options.
Supersampling increases calculation time with little effect on file size.
A potential disadvantage of supersampling is that lines
such as <a href="#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>
or hydrogen-bond representations
may become unexpectedly thin in the final image because there is a
system-dependent limit to how wide they can be drawn in the initial image.
The <b>File... Save Image</b> dialog reports the effective maximum linewidth
given the current supersampling level and image size.
It may be possible to achieve the desired linewidth by reducing 
the supersampling level and/or the pixel dimensions of the image.
</ul>
<a name="ribbonpath">
<b>Ribbon path</b></a>.  By default, the ribbon path is a smoothed spline
that may deviate from the true positions of the backbone atoms, 
making bonds to sidechains appear unnaturally short or long
(<a href="../ContributedSoftware/ribbonstyle/ribbonstyle.html#offset">details...</a>).
The path calculation can be adjusted with the command
<a href="midas/ribspline.html"><b>ribspline</b></a>,
the <a href="moleculeattrib.html">molecule model attributes panel</a>,
and the <a href="inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>.
For proteins,
a cardinal spline without smoothing is constrained to pass through
&alpha;-carbon coordinates, but gives a very rumpled ribbon;
a cardinal spline with strand-only smoothing may be a useful compromise
(<i>e.g.</i>,
<b><a href="midas/ribspline.html">ribspline</a> cardinal smooth strand</b>).
</p><p>
<a name="shadows"><b>Shadows</b></a>.
Shadows can make images more dramatic and enhance the sense of depth.
However, they can also make images more complex and darken areas of interest;
surfaces may benefit more from shadows than would &ldquo;busy&rdquo; images 
with ribbons and sticks.
If system hardware permits, <i>interactive</i> shadows can be enabled with
the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>
or the command <a href="midas/set.html#shadows"><b>set shadows</b></a>.
Shadow locations and darkness are controlled by the
<a href="#lighting">lighting</a> directionality and contrast, respectively.
Interactive shadows are often good enough for presentation images, 
and their appearance can be improved by increasing the shadow <b>quality</b>
setting in the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>
(albeit at the cost of increased graphics memory usage).
They can also be used to preview shadow locations for noninteractive rendering.
High-quality, <i>noninteractive</i> shadowed images can be produced by 
<a href="raytracing.html">raytracing with POV-Ray</a>. 
Raytracing can be quite slow, among other
<a href="raytracing.html#limitations">limitations</a>.
Noninteractive shadowed images can also be generated with
the commands <a href="midas/conic.html"><b>conic</b></a> and
<a href="midas/neon.html"><b>neon</b></a>.
</p><p>
<a name="clipping">
<b>Clipping planes</b></a> 
cut away portions of structures, surfaces and objects.
The <a href="clipping.html#global">global clipping planes</a>
shown in the <a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>
affect all models and can only be perpendicular 
to the line of sight.  In addition, each model can have a
<a href="clipping.html#per-model">per-model clipping plane</a>
oriented at any angle.
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/surfcapper/surfcapper.html"><b>Surface 
Capping</b></a> controls whether clipped surfaces appear solid or hollow.
</p><p>
<a name="transparency">
<b>Transparency</b></a>.
By default, only the topmost layer of all transparent items is shown.
This is recommended because it simplifies the display and effectively 
de-emphasizes those parts.  Whether a single transparent layer or multiple
layers is shown can be controlled
with the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>
and the command <a href="midas/set.html#singlelayer"><b>set singleLayer</b></a>.
Transparency is normally angle-dependent, such that transparent triangles 
(forming objects as well as surfaces)
appear more opaque when viewed edge-on than when viewed face-on.
However, the angle dependence can be turned off
with the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>
or the command
<a href="midas/set.html#flattransparency"><b>set flatTransparency</b></a>.
<ul>
<li><b>Surfaces</b> 
(<a href="surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface models</a>)
can be made transparent without otherwise changing their colors using
the <a href="menu.html#actsurface"><b>Actions... Surface</b> menu</a>
or the command <a href="midas/transparency.html"><b>transparency</b></a>.
<br><br>
<li><b>Atoms, bonds, and ribbons</b> 
can be made transparent without otherwise changing their colors using
the command <a href="midas/transparency.html"><b>transparency</b></a>,
or they can be assigned transparent colors directly.
These more general approaches also work for <b>surfaces</b>.
A transparent color can be defined in the 
<a href="colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a> and applied using the
<a href="menu.html#actcolor"><b>Actions... Color</b> menu</a> or
various <a href="coloring.html">coloring</a> commands.  
Transparent colors can also be specified in commands by name
(previously assigned with <a href="midas/colordef.html"><b>colordef</b></a>)
or as four comma-separated values (red, green, blue, and opacity
components, each in the range 0-1).
</ul>
<a name="labeling"><b>Labels and Arrows</b></a>.
2D text, <a href="../ContributedSoftware/2dlabels/symbols.html">symbols</a>,
and arrows of multiple colors and sizes can be added to the display with the 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/2dlabels/2dlabels.html"><b>2D Labels</b></a> 
tool (or command <a href="midas/2dlabels.html"><b>2dlabels</b></a>).
Such 2D annotations are drawn in front of any displayed objects 
and do not move when the objects are moved.
By contrast, the standard Chimera &ldquo;3D&rdquo; labels (shown with the 
<a href="menu.html#actlabel"><b>Actions... Label</b></a> menu or
commands <a href="midas/label.html"><b>label</b></a> and
<a href="midas/rlabel.html"><b>rlabel</b></a>) are associated with atoms
and move along with them. The font and size of all 3D labels collectively
and whether they should always be drawn in front are set in the 
<a href="preferences.html#Labels"><b>Labels</b> preferences</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="objects"><b>Geometric Objects</b></a>.
Spacefilling objects including 3D arrows can be created arbitrarily
with the command <a href="midas/shape.html"><b>shape</b></a>
or in <a href="bild.html">BILD format</a>. 
Axes (cylinders), planes (discs), and centroids (spheres) 
can be defined from sets of atoms using
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/structuremeas/structuremeas.html#axes">
<b>Axes/Planes/Centroids</b></a>
or the command <a href="midas/define.html"><b>define</b></a>, and ellipsoids
using <a href="midas/measure.html#inertia"><b>measure inertia</b></a>.
The <a href="../ContributedSoftware/pipesandplanks/pipesandplanks.html">
<b>PipesAndPlanks</b></a> tool 
shows protein helices and strands as cylindrical &ldquo;pipes&rdquo;
and rectangular-box &ldquo;planks,&rdquo; respectively, with thin connectors.
Axis, plane, and centroid objects as well as those from
<a href="midas/shape.html"><b>shape</b></a>
and <a href="midas/measure.html#inertia"><b>measure inertia</b></a>
are <a href="surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface models</a>,
which have the following advantages over the VRML models
from <a href="bild.html">BILD format</a> and
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/pipesandplanks/pipesandplanks.html">
<b>PipesAndPlanks</b></a>:
<ul>
<li>they better handle <a href="#transparency">transparency</a>
and/or <a href="#shadows">interactive shadows</a>
<li>they can be recolored with the

Markers (spheres) can be placed and paths between them drawn with
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Tracer</b></a>.  
Markers are implemented as atoms and thus also respond to
the <a href="menu.html#menuactions"><b>Actions</b> menu</a>
and various commands.

<b>Color Keys</b>.
A color key shows how a coloring scheme relates to quantities.
Such coloring schemes are applied by various tools and commands, including
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/render/render.html#render"><b>Render by 
Attribute</b></a>,
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Surface
Color</b></a>, and <a href="midas/rangecolor.html"><b>rangecolor</b></a>.
Color keys suitable for publication images can be created with the
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/2dlabels/2dlabels.html#colorkey"><b>Color 
Key</b></a> tool or <a href="midas/colorkey.html"><b>colorkey</b></a> command.

Wall-eye, cross-eye, <a href="stereo.html#anaglyph">red-cyan</a>,
and <a href="stereo.html#trioscopic">green-magenta</a> stereo
images can be saved by changing the graphics window to the 
corresponding <a href="stereo.html#modedef">camera mode</a> with the
<a href="sideview.html#camera"><b>Camera</b></a> tool
(or the command <a href="midas/stereo.html"><b>stereo</b></a>)
and using <a href="#imagemode"><b>Image type</b></a>: <b>same as screen</b>
in the <a href="#saveimage"><b>Save Image</b> dialog</a>.
Another way to save stereo images is by setting the
<a href="#imagemode"><b>Image type</b></a>
to <b>stereo pair</b> (cross-eye) or <b>wall-eye stereo pair</b>;
in that case, the resulting image
will be twice as wide as the specified <a href="#imagesize">size</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="colorspace"><b>Color space</b></a>. 
Some publications require images to be in the CMYK color space.
Chimera currently saves images in only the RGB color space, so
a separate application such as Adobe Photoshop&reg;
must be used to switch between the two.

<a name="colorschemes"><b>Choosing colors</b></a>.
Several factors should be considered in choosing colors, including
what the colors are meant to indicate, their distinguishability from
each other and from the background,
and whether viewers may have color vision deficiencies.
Useful websites include:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://colorbrewer2.org" target="_blank">ColorBrewer</a>
- multipurpose color-scheme picker; 3- to 12-color schemes are displayed 
on a map and rated by suitability for red-green colorblind viewers,
printing, and/or photocopying. The HEX color specifications at this site
are <a href="colortool.html#tkcode">Tk codes</a>,
which can be used as color names in many Chimera commands
and in the <a href="colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>.
<li><a href="https://www.vischeck.com" target="_blank">Vischeck</a>
- simulates the effects of color-blindness on your own uploaded image
or a specified web page
</ul>
