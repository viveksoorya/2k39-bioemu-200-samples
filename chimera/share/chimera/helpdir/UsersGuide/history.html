<h2>Command History</h2>

<table border="1" align="right" cellspacing="0" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"> 
<tr><td><img src="hist.png" alt="Command History"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The <b>Command History</b> lists previously used
<a href="framecommand.html" target="_top">commands</a>.
The commands can be re-executed and/or saved to a file.
The <b>Command History</b> can be opened from the pulldown menu 
marked by a black triangle to the right of the 
<a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>.
The menu also shows the most recently entered commands.
Commands are shown as entered even if they failed to execute 
due to mistyping or incorrect syntax.
</p><p>
In the <b>Command History</b>,
individual commands or blocks of commands may be
chosen (highlighted) using the left mouse button.
<b>Ctrl</b>-click adds to an existing choice rather than replacing it.
To choose a block of commands without dragging,
click on the first (or last) and then <b>Shift</b>-click on the
last (or first) in the desired block.
In the figure, three commands are chosen.
</p><p>
When the mouse focus is in the 
<a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>
or <a href="chimerawindow.html">graphics window</a>,
<b>Ctrl-u</b> erases the command line contents, and
the history can be navigated with
<b>Ctrl-p</b> (previous command) and <b>Ctrl-n</b> (next command).
Additionally pressing <b>Shift</b> indicates navigating to 
the next/previous occurrence of the same command name
(initial set of characters) 
instead of to whatever command is immediately adjacent in the history.
Navigation skips commands for which the entire line is identical.
When the mouse focus is in the 
<a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>
(not the graphics window),
another way to navigate the history is with 
the keyboard <b>up arrow</b> and <b>down arrow</b>,
alone or in combination with <b>Shift</b>.
</p><p>
<b>Record...</b> brings up a <a href="opensave.html">dialog</a> 
for saving or appending commands to a
<a href="filetypes.html#command">file</a>.
The chosen commands or all commands in the history can be saved, 
as Chimera commands or their 
<a href="#translations">Python translations</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Execute</b> executes the chosen commands in the order shown;
double-clicking an individual command executes that command.
<b>Delete</b> removes the chosen commands from the history.
<b>Copy</b> copies the chosen commands as plain text that can be
pasted into another application window.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Command History</b> window; <b>Help</b> opens
this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
Recently used commands are saved upon exiting from Chimera and will appear 
in the <b>Command History</b> of the next session that uses the same
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>.
How many commands to remember between sessions is specified in the
<a href="preferences.html#Command Line"><b>Command Line</b> preferences</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="translations">Python Translations</a> of Commands</h3>
<p>
A file containing the Python translations of commands cannot be executed in
Chimera until statements to import any necessary modules have been added.
In some cases, adding
<tt><pre>
import Midas
</pre></tt>
to the beginning of the file will be sufficient;
however, additional modules may need to be imported,
depending on the particular commands included
and any further code that is added to the file.
</p><p>
A Python script can be executed by simply
<a href="filetypes.html">opening</a> it in Chimera,
or if it has command-line arguments, using the command
<b><A href="midas/runscript.html">runscript</A></b> or the
startup option <b><A href="options.html#script">--script</A></b>.
