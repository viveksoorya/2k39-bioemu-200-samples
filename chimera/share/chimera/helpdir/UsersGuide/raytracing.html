<p>
The <a href="https://www.povray.org"
target="_blank">Persistence of Vision Raytracer</a> (POV-Ray)
is included with Chimera.  POV-Ray images can be saved:
<ul>
<li>with <a href="print.html"><b>Save Image</b></a>
<li>with the <a href="midas/copy.html"><b>copy</b></a> command
<li>when <a href="movies.html">making movies</a>
</ul>
Only the PNG image format can be saved
(see <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>).
For each raytraced image, Chimera first generates two POV-Ray input files:
<ul>
<li> scene description (*.pov file)
<li> raytracing options (*.ini file)
</ul>
The raytracing calculation is then run as a background job 
that can be monitored or canceled using the
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/idle/task.html"><b>Task Panel</b></a>.
Several raytracing parameters can be set in the
<a href="preferences.html#POV-Ray Options"><b>POV-Ray Options</b> 
preferences</a>.

<h3>Lights and Shadows</h3>
<p>
Chimera includes ambient light and up to three directional lights: 
key, fill, and back (<a href="lighting.html">details...</a>). 
Lighting parameters can be adjusted
with the <a href="sideview.html#lighting"><b>Lighting</b> tool</a> 
or <a href="midas/lighting.html"><b>lighting</b></a> command
and are propogated to POV-Ray for raytracing.
By default, only the key light produces shiny highlights and shadows.
Shadows from raytracing can be made less severe by decreasing the 
<b>contrast</b>.  Also, it may be useful to move the lights 
(change their directions) and/or adjust the <b>key-fill ratio</b>.
</p><p>
Interactive shadows can be used to preview shadow locations.
If system hardware permits, these can be enabled with
the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>
or the command <a href="midas/set.html#shadows"><b>set shadows</b></a>.
In some cases, interactive shadows may suffice as an alternative to raytracing;
their appearance can be improved by increasing the shadow <b>quality</b>
setting in the <a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b> tool</a>
(albeit at the cost of increased graphics memory usage).
</p>

<a name="speedup">
<h3>Balancing Time Requirements and Results</h3></a>
<p>
Sometimes a considerable speedup in raytracing can be obtained with 
little change in output appearance by adjusting settings in the
<a href="preferences.html#POV-Ray Options"><b>POV-Ray Options</b> 
preferences</a>.  This is particularly true for
<a href="movies.html">movies</a>, 
which are compressed to some extent during encoding.
Changes to consider include:
<ul>
<li>decreasing the
<a href="preferences.html#POV-Ray Options"><b>quality</b></a> to 4 or 5
[<a href="https://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/223/#s02_01_02_08_01"
target="_blank">quality details</a> at the POV-Ray site]
<li>increasing the
<a href="preferences.html#POV-Ray Options"><b>antialias threshold</b></a>
to 1.5 or even higher (maximum 3.0)
[<a href="https://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/223/#s02_01_02_08_04"
target="_blank">antialias details</a> at the POV-Ray site]
<li>if objects are not intentionally sliced, making sure that
<a href="clipping.html#global">global clipping</a> is turned off;
to adjust depth cueing, use the <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> parameters in
<a href="sideview.html#effects"><b>Effects</b></a>
rather than moving the global clipping planes, which would turn clipping on
</ul>
There is no single answer as to which values will optimally balance
time requirements and results, as it will depend on the contents of the
scene, the available computational power, and the patience of the user.
Running a few tests is recommended before committing to raytracing
a large set of images with a particular set of parameters.
</p><p>
Raytracing jobs can be monitored and canceled using the
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/idle/task.html"><b>Task Panel</b></a>.
</p>

<a name="limitations">
<h3>Raytracing Limitations</h3></a>
<p>
Raytracing can be quite slow; see <a href="#speedup">balancing 
time requirements and results</a>.
</p><p>
Using transparency or <a href="clipping.html">clipping</a> 
may increase rendering time significantly.  
If objects are not actually clipped, clipping should be turned off,
as mentioned <a href="#speedup">above</a>.
</p><p>
The <b>max_trace_level</b> parameter is set to 10 to improve 
multi-level transparency
[<a href="https://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/264/"
target="_blank">details</a> at the POV-Ray site],
but this also increases time and memory requirements relative to lower levels.
</p><p>
Only the PNG format can be saved.
</p><p>
If image dimensions are specified in
<a href="print.html#printunits">units of length</a> rather than pixels,
they are multiplied by the <a href="print.html#resolution">resolution</a> 
to give the correct number of output pixels, 
but the dimensions in units of length are &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; 
(not included in the image file).
</p><p>
A raytraced image from POV-Ray may differ from the view in Chimera 
in several ways.  Some differences are desirable, such as the presence 
of shadows.  Others reflect current limitations of the POV-Ray format 
and/or its implementation in Chimera:
</p>
<ul>
<li>colors may differ slightly
<li>shading along <a href="representation.html#ribbon">ribbons</a>
may be stairstepped; using the <b>supersmooth</b> style instead of 
<b>rounded</b> reduces this effect
<li><a href="sideview.html#lighting">light source</a> directions but not
colors are translated from Chimera
<li>although object 
<a href="sideview.html#shininess">shininess and brightness</a> levels 
(but not specular color) are translated from Chimera,
apparent shininess may differ
<li>if <a href="sideview.html#effects">depth cueing</a> is used,
the background of the raytraced image: 
  <ul>
  <li>will not be transparent even if the
  <a href="preferences.html#POV-Ray Options">transparent background</a>
  option is turned on
  <li>will match the <a href="sideview.html#effects">depth-cueing</a> color
  even if the background is a different color in Chimera
  </ul>
<li>the following are omitted or otherwise not handled:
<a href="sideview.html#silhouette">silhouettes</a>,
<a href="preferences.html#Selection">selection highlighting</a>,
<a href="stereo.html">stereo</a>,
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
