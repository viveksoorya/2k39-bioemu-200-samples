<h2>The Model Panel and Ensembles Tutorial</h2>
<p>
This tutorial focuses on using the 
<a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
and handling ensembles of structures (such as those determined by NMR).
</p><p>
We will view solution structures of a toxin that binds to sodium channels.
Separate ensembles were determined for <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-proline 
conformations of this toxin:

Start Chimera by clicking or doubleclicking the <b>Chimera</b> icon
<img src="Chimera-icon.png" width="20px"> (depending on its location).
Typically, this icon will be present on the desktop.
The Chimera executable can also be run from its
installation location (<a href="../startup.html">details...</a>).
</p><p>
A splash screen will appear, to be replaced in a few seconds
by the main Chimera <a href="../chimerawindow.html">graphics window</a>
or <a href="../rapid.html"><b>Rapid Access</b></a> interface (it does not
matter which, the following instructions will work with either).
If you like, resize the Chimera window by dragging its lower right corner.
Show the <a href="../chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>
by choosing <b>Tools... General Controls... Command Line</b> from the menu.
</p><p>
If you have internet connectivity, structures can be obtained directly from the
<a href="https://www.rcsb.org" target="_blank">Protein Data Bank</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/open.html">open</a> 1g1p</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/open.html">open</a> 1g1z</b>
</blockquote>
If you do not have internet connectivity, 
you can <a href="download.html">download</a> the files
<a href="1g1p.pdb.gz">1g1p.pdb.gz</a> and
<a href="1g1z.pdb.gz">1g1z.pdb.gz</a>
into your working directory and then open them in that order
as local files (with <b>File... Open</b>).  
It is not necessary to uncompress the files.
</p><p>
Use the ribbons <a href="../menu.html#menupresets">preset</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Menu</i>:&nbsp;<b>Presets... Interactive 1 (ribbons)</b>
</blockquote>
This may or may not change the appearance, depending on your 
preference settings.
</p><p>
<a href="../mouse.html">Rotate, translate, and scale</a> the structures
as desired throughout the tutorial.
There are <a href="../extension.html">several ways</a>
to start tools, including from the menu or with a command. 
Open the <a href="../modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/start.html">start</a> Model Panel</b>
</blockquote>
The <b>Model Panel</b> lists models on the left and
<a href="../modelpanel.html#functions">functions</a> on the right.
</p><p>
A file of coordinates opened in Chimera becomes a <b><i>model</i></b>
with an associated ID number and <a href="../hierarchy.html">model color</a>.
Some PDB files are further subdivided into multiple structures
designated with <tt>MODEL</tt> and <tt>ENDMDL</tt> records;  
these are assigned <b><i>submodel</i></b> numbers.  Since each structure
can be handled independently, the general term &ldquo;model&rdquo; 
can refer to a submodel as well as a model that is not subdivided.
</p><p>
Each of these PDB files is an NMR ensemble of several structures (submodels).
At first, the submodels in a model are collapsed into a single row.
Expand the listing to individual submodels:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b><i>choose</i></b> one model by clicking its ID or name in the left side
of the panel
<li>click the <b>group/ungroup</b> function button on the right
</ol>
<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px" 
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td><img src="modpaninit.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Repeat the process for the other model.
<b>1g1p</b> (<i>trans</i>-proline conformations, white) 
has been opened as models 0.1&ndash;0.18
and <b>1g1z</b> (<i>cis</i>-proline conformations, magenta) 
as models 1.1&ndash;1.18.  
</p><p>
By default, the list of
<a href="../modelpanel.html#functions">functions</a> on the right side
of the <b>Model Panel</b> includes only those classified as
<b>favorites</b>.  If you do not see some function that is mentioned, 
try changing from <b>favorites</b> to <b>all</b> functions
using the checkbutton below the list.
</p><p>
Scroll down the list of models in the left side of the 
<b>Model Panel</b> and choose model <b>1.2</b>. Try various functions:
<blockquote>
 <b>show only</b> - hide the other models
 <br><b>show all atoms</b> - display all atoms
 <br><b>select</b> - <a href="../selection.html">select</a> the entire model
  for further operations
</blockquote>
By default, ribbons suppress backbone atom display.  Hide the ribbon
to reveal the backbone atoms:
<blockquote>
<i>Menu</i>:&nbsp;<b>Actions... Ribbon... hide</b>
</blockquote>
Select and delete hydrogens in <i>all</i> models:
<blockquote>
<i>Menu</i>:&nbsp;<b>Select... Chemistry... element... H</b>
<br>
<i>Menu</i>:&nbsp;<b>Actions... Atoms/Bonds... delete</b>
</blockquote>
When atoms might be needed later, <b>hide</b> should be used
instead of <b>delete</b>.
</p><p>
Back to the <b>Model Panel</b>:
<blockquote>
<b>sequence...</b> 
(it may be necessary to change from <b>favorites</b> to <b>all</b> 
to see this function in the <b>Model Panel</b>)
opens a <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/multalignviewer/framemav.html"
target="_top">sequence window</a> for the model.
Two very short &beta;-strands (positions 24-25 and 29-30) 
are highlighted in light green.  Placing the mouse cursor over a residue
in the sequence shows the corresponding structure residue number
at the bottom of the sequence window.  The &beta;-strand locations 
were read from the input file along with the coordinates.
Highlight a string of residues in the sequence with the mouse
and see how they become <a href="../selection.html">selected</a>
in the structure.  <b>Quit</b> from the sequence window, 
then act on the selection with the menu:
<b>Actions... Color... orange</b>
</blockquote>
Clear the selection (Ctrl-click in an empty area of the graphics window) 
and go back to showing only ribbons:
<blockquote>
<i>Menu</i>:&nbsp;<b>Presets... Interactive 1 (ribbons)</b>
</blockquote>
Note the orange coloring is gone; 
<a href="../menu.html#menupresets">interactive presets</a> reset the coloring,
whereas <a href="../menu.html#menupresets">publication presets</a>
do not adjust colors, aside from making the background white.
</p><p>
The ribbon shows the &beta;-strands as arrows.  
Although the input file specifies the strand locations as 24-25 and 29-30, 
the <a href="#reference">paper</a>
describes three &beta;-strands, comprised of residues 8-10, 23-26, and 28-31.
Such differences are common because secondary structure assignments are
method- and parameter-dependent.  Secondary structure assignments could
be recomputed with <a href="../midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>,
but if the desired assignments are already known, it is much more efficient
to change them directly:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/setattr.html">setattr</a> r isStrand true :8-10,23-26,28-31</b>
</blockquote>
This command assigns values of the
<a href="../midas/atom_spec.html#resprops">residue attribute</a> named 
<b>isStrand</b>.  In this case, it is not necessary to set
<b>isStrand</b> (or <b>isHelix</b>) to false for any residues, 
since the original strand residues are still in strands and none of the
new strand residues were in &alpha;-helices.
Secondary structure assignments can also be changed by
<a href="../selection.html">selecting</a> residues and using the
<a href="../inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a>.
</p><p>
The strands can be emphasized with color:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/color.html">color</a> blue #1.2</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/color.html">color</a> yellow #1.2 & strand</b>
</blockquote>
(For those who prefer a graphical interface, there is also a 
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/colorss/colorss.html"><b>Color
Secondary Structure</b></a> tool and associated
<b>color by SS</b> function in the <b>Model Panel</b>.)
</p><p>
<a name="hideshow">
In the <b>Model Panel</b>, the <b>S</b> (<b>Shown</b>) checkboxes</a> toggle
<a href="../hierarchy.html#displevels">model display</a> without changing 
the display settings of individual atoms, bonds, and ribbon segments.
<blockquote>
uncheck the <b>S</b> box for model 1.2
<br><br>
check the <b>S</b> box for model 1.2
</blockquote>
The <b><a href="../midas/modeldisplay.html">modeldisplay</a></b> command
does the same thing.  Show all of the models:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/modeldisplay.html">modeldisp</a></b>
</blockquote>
The <b>A</b> (<b>Active</b>) checkboxes in the <b>Model Panel</b>
control what can be moved:
<blockquote>
uncheck the <b>A</b> box for model 1.2 and try moving the structures
<a href="../mouse.html">with the mouse</a>; now only the other models can be 
rotated and translated
<br><br>
check the <b>A</b> box for model 1.2 and try moving the structures
again
</blockquote>
Reset to the original model positions:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/reset.html">reset</a></b>
</blockquote>
We will use
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ensemblecluster/ensemblecluster.html">
<b>Ensemble Cluster</b></a> to cluster each ensemble and
identify representative structures, then
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ensemblematch/ensemblematch.html">
<b>Ensemble Match</b></a> to compare the representatives.
</p><p>
Start <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ensemblecluster/ensemblecluster.html">
<b>Ensemble Cluster</b></a> (under <b>Tools... MD/Ensemble Analysis</b>)
and choose <b>1g1p</b> as the ensemble to cluster.  Leave the <b>Parts
to Match</b> blank to use all atoms and click <b>OK</b>.  
Results are shown in a cluster list dialog; three clusters were found.
In that dialog,
<blockquote>
if options are not shown under <b>Treatment of Chosen Clusters</b>,
click the black arrowhead to reveal them
<br><br>
set the treatment options to <b>Color [all members]</b> and 
<b>Choose [representatives] in Model Panel</b>
<br><br>
choose all three cluster lines in the dialog with the mouse
</blockquote>
Now the submodels of <b>1g1p</b> (#0) are shown in three different colors
for the three clusters, and only the three cluster representatives are chosen
in the left side of the <b>Model Panel</b>.
In the right side of the <b>Model Panel</b>, click <b>show only</b>
to hide all models except those three representatives.
<b>Quit</b> from the cluster dialog, then
delete the undisplayed members of the <b>1g1p</b> ensemble:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/delete.html">delete</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;#0/!display</b>
</blockquote>
This command deletes models with ID number 0 and model display turned off.
</p><p>
Start <a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ensemblecluster/ensemblecluster.html">
<b>Ensemble Cluster</b></a> again and cluster <b>1g1z</b> using all atoms.
This time, four clusters are found.  
Keeping the treatment settings the same as used before, choose just
the two clusters with more than one structure, and again
click <b>show only</b> in the <b>Model Panel</b>.
<b>Quit</b> from the cluster dialog and
delete the undisplayed members of the <b>1g1z</b> ensemble:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/delete.html">delete</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;#1/!display</b>
</blockquote>
In the left side of the <b>Model Panel</b>,
drag with the mouse to choose all five remaining models.
Use <b>Model Panel</b> functions to show them, assign them unique colors,
and spread them out into a plane:
<blockquote>
  <b>show</b> - show all five models
  <br><b>rainbow...</b>  
  click <b>OK</b> to rainbow-color the models using default settings
  <br><b>tile...</b> 
  click <b>OK</b> to spread the models out into a plane
</blockquote>
Finally, compare the structures with
<a href="../../ContributedSoftware/ensemblematch/ensemblematch.html">
<b>Ensemble Match</b></a> (under <b>Tools... MD/Ensemble Analysis</b>).
Choose one ensemble as the reference and the other as the alternative.  
For <b>Parts to Match</b> just 
<a href="../midas/atom_spec.html#basic">specify</a> the backbone atoms:
<blockquote>
<b>@n,ca,c,o</b>
</blockquote>
</p>
<table border="1" align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px" 
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td><img src="enstut.png"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Click <b>OK</b> to calculate the matches.
Results are shown as a 3 x 2 (or 2 x 3) table with entries for all 
pairwise comparisons between the ensembles.
The <b>A</b> and <b>D</b> buttons control model 
<a href="../mouse.html#activedef">activation for motion</a> and
<a href="../hierarchy.html#displevels">model display</a>, respectively.
The numbers in the table are pairwise RMSDs using the atoms 
that were specified as <b>Parts to Match</b>.
</p><p>
The structures are not yet superimposed.  Clicking a button next to an
RMSD value performs the corresponding match and reports
in the <a href="../chimerawindow.html#statusline">status line</a>
the number of atom pairs used.
Superimpose each <i>cis</i>-proline conformation in model 1 on the 
most similar (lowest-RMSD) <i>trans</i>-proline conformation in model 0.
</p><p>
In this case, <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> refer to the peptide bond between
leucine-12 and proline-13.  Display these residues as ball-and-stick:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/display.html">disp</a> :12-13</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/represent.html">repr</a> bs</b>
</blockquote>
The proline rings look somewhat distorted, especially in the 
<i>cis</i>-proline structures (currently red and yellow).  By default,
the ribbon path is a smoothed B-spline that does not pass exactly through 
the true positions of the backbone atoms.  Bonds to backbone atoms are
drawn to the ribbon and thus may appear to be stretched. 
Try a cardinal spline instead, which gives a messier-looking ribbon 
but follows the backbone atom positions more closely, 
even when some smoothing is applied:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/ribspline.html">ribspline</a> cardinal</b>
<br>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/ribspline.html">ribsp</a> card smooth strand</b>
</blockquote>
To return to the default B-spline ribbon:
<blockquote>
<i>Command</i>: <b><a href="../midas/ribspline.html">ribsp</a> bspline</b>
</blockquote>
When finished viewing the structures,
choose <b>File... Quit</b> from the menu to exit from Chimera.
