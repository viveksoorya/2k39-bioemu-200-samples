<h2>Stereo</h2>
<p>
The <a name="modedef"><b><i>camera mode</i></b></a> refers to any of several
stereo and mono viewing options.  
The camera mode of the Chimera graphics window can be controlled with
the command <a href="midas/stereo.html"><b>stereo</b></a>,
the <a href="sideview.html#camera"><b>Camera</b></a> tool,
or the menu raised by double-clicking the eye position in the
<a href="sideview.html#sideview"><b>Side View</b></a>.
It can also be specified at Chimera startup with
<a href="options.html#stereo"><b>--stereo</b></a>.
The <a href="print.html#imagemode"><b>Image type</b></a>
(camera mode for output image files)
can differ from the mode shown in the graphics window.
</p><p>
Available camera modes:
<ul>
<li><b>mono</b> - standard single view, not in stereo
<br><br>
<li><b>stereo left eye</b> - single view from the left-eye position
<br><br>
<li><b>stereo right eye</b> - single view from the right-eye position
<br><br>
<li><b>cross-eye stereo</b> 
- side-by-side views, with the left-eye view on the right 
and the right-eye view on the left
<br><br>
<li><b>wall-eye stereo</b>
- side-by-side views, with the left-eye view on the left 
and the right-eye view on the right
<br><br>
<li>
<a name="anaglyph">
<b>red-cyan</b> <b>stereo</b></a> (also known as <b>anaglyph</b>)
- overlapping left-eye and right-eye views in different colors, to be viewed
with &ldquo;glasses&rdquo;
(often inexpensive cardboard/plastic) with colored filters.
The red channel is used for the left-eye view, 
green and blue for the right-eye view.
This setting works best with red-cyan glasses, but reasonably well
with red-blue or red-green glasses.  Some ghosting will always be present 
unless the glasses are perfectly matched to the frequencies of light
emitted by the display.  Stereo cues will be greater when colors 
with a balance of red and blue/green components are used, for example,
grayscale, magenta, and yellow rather than red, green, blue, or cyan.
The red, green, and blue component values of a color can be viewed by
entering its <a href="colortables.html">name</a> in the
<a href="colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>.
<br><br>
<li>
<a name="trioscopic">
<b>green-magenta</b> <b>stereo</b></a> (also known as <b>trioscopic</b>)
- similar to red-cyan stereo, but with green and magenta instead of
red and cyan, and different trade-offs.
From 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D#Anaglyphic_color_channels"
target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:
&ldquo;better reds, oranges and wider range of blues than red/cyan&rdquo;
and &ldquo;less chromatic aberration.&rdquo;
<br><br>
<li><b>sequential stereo</b>
- rapid flickering between left-eye and right-eye views, 
to be viewed with special synchronised glasses.  
Sequential stereo needs 
<a href="https://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/wiki/hardware#StereoHardware"
target="_blank">special hardware</a>.
<br><br>
<li><b>reverse sequential stereo</b>
- as above, but swapping the two views to accommodate devices that
use the opposite convention
<br><br>
<li><b>row stereo, right eye even</b>
- row-interleaved stereo, with even rows used for the right-eye view 
and odd rows used for the left-eye view.
Row-interleaved stereo is used by 3D displays from 
<a href="https://www.miracube.net/product/" target="_blank">Miracube</a>
and others.  Users of these devices can try both row stereo options in Chimera
to see which gives the best result.
<br><br>
<li><b>row stereo, right eye odd</b>
- as above, except swapping the two views to accommodate devices that
use the opposite convention
<br><br>
<li><b>dome</b>
- angular fisheye of the hemisphere in front of the camera,
with <a href="sideview.html#fov">horizontal field of view</a> 
locked to 90&deg;
<br><br>
<li><b>truncated dome</b>
- same as the dome mode, except with the bottom of the hemisphere cut off
<br><br>
<li><b>DTI side-by-side stereo</b> - for stereo viewing with
<a href="https://new3dt.com/about-us/" target="_blank">DTI</a> technology
</ul>
