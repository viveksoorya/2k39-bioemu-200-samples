<h2>RMF Viewer</h2></a>
<p>
Chimera provides an interface for exploring data in
<a href="https://integrativemodeling.org/rmf/format.html"
target="_blank">Rich Molecular Format</a> (RMF).
An RMF file may include:
<ul>
<li>hierarchical molecular structure information, 
generally particles at various levels of detail (not necessarily atomic)
<li>features associated with parts of structures, 
generally restraints and their values
<li>geometric markup, such as boundaries related to restraints
</ul>
The command <a href="midas/rmfalias.html"><b>rmfalias</b></a> can be
used to create command-line aliases for sets of nodes currently open
in <b>RMF Viewer</b>, allowing their control via
<a href="framecommand.html" target="_top">Chimera commands</a>.
See also:
<a href="https://www.integrativemodeling.org/" target="_blank">Integrative
Modeling Platform (IMP)</a>
</p><p>
When an RMF file is <a href="filetypes.html">opened</a> in Chimera,
the structure is displayed in the graphics window, and 
associated data and controls are shown in an <b>RMF Viewer</b> dialog. 
The dialog may contain up to three sections:
<ul>
<li><a href="#hierarchy"><b>Hierarchy</b></a>
<li><a href="#features"><b>Features</b></a>
<li><a href="#trajectory"><b>Trajectory Playback Controls</b></a>
</ul>
<b>Hide</b> hides the dialog; it can be raised later from its
<a href="instances.html">instance in the <b>Tools</b> menu</a>.
<b>Quit</b> closes the dialog and the structure.
<b>Help</b> brings up this manual page in a browser window.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="hierarchy">Hierarchy</a></h3>
<!--
<table align="right" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"
cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td><img src="castp.png" alt="RMF hierarchy"></td></tr>
</table>
-->
<p>
The <b>Hierarchy</b> section is always present
and contains the structural hierarchy and any geometric markup.
</p><p>
The main part of this section
shows a tree of the structural objects and their groupings,
with + and &ndash; signs to expand and collapse nodes, respectively.
Clicking a node in the tree highlights it, and double-clicking a node 
<a href="selection.html">selects</a> any
corresponding parts of the graphical representation and 
highlights/plots any corresponding <a href="#features">features</a>.
This can be done for multiple nodes at a time 
(for a contiguous block: click, Shift-doubleclick; for disjoint rows:
click, Ctrl-click any number of times, Ctrl-doubleclick on the last).
</p><p>
Buttons on the right also act on the chosen node(s):
<ul>
<li><b>Select</b> - <a href="selection.html">select</a> 
the graphical representation of the node
<li><b>Show</b> - show the graphical representation of the node;
if there are separate representations for 
different levels from the node on down to the leaves,
show the highest-level representation only
<li><b>Show children</b> - if there are separate representations for
the node and its children (the next lower level), show the representation
of the children only
<li><b>Show leaves</b> - if there are separate representations for
different levels from the node on down to the leaves (terminal nodes),
show the leaf representation only
<li><b>Hide</b> - hide the graphical representation of the node
</ul>
If there are separate representations for different levels and the
nodes are annotated with resolution values, the <b>Resolution</b> slider
can be used to change the level of detail accordingly.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="features">Features</a></h3>
<p>
The <b>Features</b> section will appear if the file includes
feature annotations, which are generally restraints on the structural objects
and associated values.
</p><p>
On the left is a tree of the features and their values,
with + and &ndash; signs to expand and collapse nodes, respectively.
Clicking a node in the tree highlights it,
and double-clicking a node plots its value(s) in the graph on the right 
and highlights/<a href="selection.html">selects</a>
any corresponding items in the <a href="#hierarchy">structural hierarchy</a>.
This can be done for multiple nodes at a time 
(for a contiguous block: click, Shift-doubleclick; for disjoint rows:
click, Ctrl-click any number of times, Ctrl-doubleclick on the last).
</p><p>
The graph on the right shows feature values for all (one or more) frames
described in the file; if multiple frames, moving the dashed vertical line
is one way to control <a href="#trajectory">trajectory</a> playback.
</p>

<h3><a href="#top" class="nounder"><b>&larr;</b></a>
<a name="trajectory">Trajectory Playback Controls</a></h3>
<p>
Trajectory playback controls will be shown if the file describes more
than one frame. Multiple frames could represent a time series or
multiple solutions to an optimization problem.
</p>
<table border cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="margin:8px 8px 8px 8px"> 
<tr><td><img src="controls.png" alt="RMF trajectory controls"></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The <b>Step size</b> indicates showing every N<sup>th</sup> frame
during playback.</a>  The current <b>Frame</b> number is reported.
From left to right, the buttons mean: play backward continuously;
go back one step; pause; go forward one step; play forward continuously; 
toggle looping (default on; lighter background when turned off).
When looping is on, forward play can wrap from the end to the beginning
and reverse play can wrap from the beginning to the end.
The rate of continuous play can be adjusted
with the <b>Playback speed</b> slider.
</p><p>
Another way to control trajectory frame display is by 
moving the dashed vertical line in the graph
in the <a href="#features"><b>Features</b></a> section.
