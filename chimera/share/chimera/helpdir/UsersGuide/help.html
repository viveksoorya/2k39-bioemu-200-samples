<h2>Help</h2>
<p>
Extensive help is available for Chimera;
the <a href="index.html" target="_top"><b>User's Guide</b></a> and
<a href="../ProgrammersGuide/index.html" target="_top"><b>Programmer's
Guide</b></a> are written in HTML and can be displayed using the
web browser of choice.  This HTML documentation is bundled with a 
Chimera download and can be accessed from the Chimera <b>Help</b> menu.
Use of the bundled documentation is recommended
because it is synchronized with the locally installed version of Chimera.
(The development version of the <b>User's Guide</b> is
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docindex.html"
target="_blank">available online</a> for viewing,
but may describe features that have not yet been released.)

To call up the manual page for a specific 
<a href="framecommand.html" target="_top"><i>command</i></a>, type
into the <a href="chimerawindow.html#emulator"><b>Command Line</b></a>:
<blockquote>
<a href="midas/help.html"><b>help</b></a> <i>command</i>
</blockquote>
whereas the following will show the entire
<a href="framecommand.html" target="_top"><b>Commands Index</b></a>:
<blockquote>
<a href="midas/help.html"><b>help</b></a> <b>commands</b>
</blockquote>
The <a href="midas/help.html"><b>help</b></a> command without any arguments
calls up the <a href="menu.html#localsearch">documentation search</a> dialog.
</p><p>
Many of the tools and interfaces have <b>Help</b> buttons that
open their respective manual pages. Some tools and interfaces also supply
<a name="balloon"><b><i>balloon help</i></b></a>, 
explanatory text that pops up when the cursor 
is paused over some relevant part of a dialog.
Whether to show balloon help can be set in the
<a href="preferences.html#Messages"><b>Messages</b> preferences</a>.
</p><p>
When the graphics window has mouse focus, pausing the cursor
over an atom or bond (without clicking any buttons) 
shows an <b><i>atomspec balloon</i></b> with information such as atom name, 
residue number, and bond length.  The style of atomspec balloons and 
whether they should be shown can be set in the
<a href="preferences.html#Labels"><b>Labels</b> preferences</a>.
