<title>Relative Exposure of Amino Acids</title>
</head><body>
<h2>Relative Exposure of Amino Acids</h2>
<p>
The relative exposure of an amino acid indicates its degree of burial
in a structure.  Relative exposure can be calculated by normalizing 
the surface area of the residue in the structure by the surface area 
of the same type of residue in some reference state.
Although raw (non-normalized) surface areas could be used to classify 
residues as buried or exposed, normalization reduces the bias toward 
classifying smaller residues as more buried and larger as more exposed.
</p><p>
Chimera displays <b><i>solvent-excluded</i></b> molecular surfaces
composed of probe contact, toroidal, and reentrant surface.
These differ from <b><i>solvent-accessible</i></b> 
surfaces, which are traced out by the probe center.
The surfaces and their analytical areas are computed by the MSMS package.
When a <a href="representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
is generated in Chimera,
total areas are given in the <a href="reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>,
and solvent-excluded and solvent-accessible surface areas
per residue are assigned as
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">
attributes</a> named <b>areaSES</b> and <b>areaSAS</b>, respectively.
Normalized surface areas are not calculated automatically, but one 
approach is given below.
</p><p>
Gly-X-Gly tripeptides in which X is the residue type of interest
are often used as the reference state.
Solvent-excluded surface areas of the 20 standard amino acids in 
Gly-X-Gly tripeptides have been kindly supplied by the Murgita group
as supplementary data for:

Importantly, these areas were calculated in Chimera using the 
<b><i>default radii</i></b> for atoms and surface probe
(confirmed by communication with the authors).
The values have been reformatted into a 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attrfile">file
for attribute assignment</a> in Chimera:
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/areaSESgxg.txt">areaSESgxg.txt</a>
</p><p>
To calculate normalized areas for amino acid residues in a protein structure:
<ol>
<li>Open the structure in Chimera and generate a 
<a href="representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
using the default atomic and probe radii
(<b><A href="midas/surface.html">surface</A></b> command or
<A href="menu.html#actsurface"><b>Actions... Surface... show</b></a>
in the menu). This automatically creates the residue attribute <b>areaSES</b>,
solvent-excluded surface areas in the structure.
If needed, use <a href="midas/split.html"><b>split</b></a> or
<a href="midas/msms.html"><b>surfcat</b></a> to make the surface
enclose the desired set(s) of atoms, for example, 
each protein chain individually rather than all of the chains collectively.
<br><br>
<li>From this page, <a href="tutorials/download.html">save</a> the file
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/areaSESgxg.txt">areaSESgxg.txt</a>
as plain text.
<br><br>
<li>Start
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html"><b>Define
Attribute</b></a> (in menu under <b>Tools... Structure Analysis</b>) and
browse to open
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/areaSESgxg.txt">areaSESgxg.txt</a>.
This creates the residue attribute <b>areaSESgxg</b>, 
solvent-excluded surface areas in the Gly-X-Gly context.
<br><br>
<li>Start
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/calculator/calculator.html"><b>Attribute
Calculator</b></a> (in menu under <b>Tools... Structure Analysis</b>) and
define a new attribute for <b>residues</b>, for example named <b>relSESA</b>,
according to the formula:
<blockquote>
<b>residue.areaSES/residue.areaSESgxg</b>
</blockquote>
Warnings about calculation failures generally can be disregarded, as they
refer to non-amino acid residues such as water molecules.
</ol>
As with any other
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attribute</a>, 
values of the new residue attribute (<b>relSESA</b> in this example) 
can be <a href="../ContributedSoftware/render/render.html#render">shown 
with color</a>, used in 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/render/render.html#select">selection</a>
and command-line <a href="midas/frameatom_spec.html" target="_top">atom 
specification</a>, and 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/render/render.html#saving">saved</a> to a file.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>less applicable to terminal residues and residues with missing atoms
<li>applies only to standard amino acids (not MSE, <i>etc.</i>)
<li><a href="../ContributedSoftware/dockprep/dockprep.html"><b>Dock
Prep</b></a> could be used beforehand to repair truncated sidechains 
and mutate MSE to MET, but turning off (unchecking) hydrogen addition and
other options is recommended for purposes of surface area calculation
<li>normalized areas may exceed 1.0 because the areas in the Gly-X-Gly 
reference state are not the <i>maximum</i> possible areas
<li>depending on the definition of the reference state, there may be other
equally valid sets of normalization denominators
<li>other reasonable measures of burial may not use surface areas at all
</ul>
