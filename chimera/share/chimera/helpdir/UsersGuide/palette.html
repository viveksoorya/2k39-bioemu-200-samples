A <b><i>palette</i></b> is an ordered set of colors and associated
method of interpolation.</a>
</p><p>
The <b>Palette Editor</b> allows creating custom palettes and
choosing a palette from numerous preset options and any previously
created custom palettes.  See also:
the <a href="colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>,
<a href="midas/background.html"><b>background</b></a>
</p><p>
There are <a href="extension.html">several ways to start</a>
the <b>Palette Editor</b>, a tool in the <b>Utilities</b> category.
In addition, clicking a <a name="palettewell"><b><i>palette well</i></b></a>
(analogous to a <a href="coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>
but rectangular rather than square, such as used for a
<a href="preferences.html#gradient">gradient</a> in the
<a href="preferences.html#Background"><b>Background</b> preferences</a>)
opens the <b>Palette Editor</b>.
</p><p>
<a name="interpolation">
<b>Interpolation</b> options:
</a>
<ul>
<li><b>HLS</b> (default) 
- in hue-lightness-saturation (colorwheel) color space
<li><b>RGB</b> - in red-green-blue color space
<li><b>discrete</b> - no interpolation, 
sharp transitions from one color to another
</ul>
The <b>Presets</b> section provides access to many built-in color schemes.
The schemes were copied from
<a href="https://colorbrewer2.org" target="_blank">ColorBrewer</a>
on May 19, 2011, and should be credited as follows:
<blockquote>
Brewer, Cynthia A., 2011.

</blockquote>
The preset schemes are categorized by <b>Type</b> based on the
data they were designed to represent:
<ul>
<li><b>sequential</b> - unsigned ordered data (magnitude comparisons)
<li><b>diverging</b> - signed ordered data or other situations
where the two extremes are to be emphasized equally 
<li><b>qualitative</b> - categories or groupings without magnitude comparisons
</ul>
The <b>Custom</b> section provides a user-specified number of
<a href="coloring.html#colorwell">color wells</a> (up to 12)
for defining a new palette.  Clicking a color well brings up the 
<a href="colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a> for interactive color 
definition.  The colors together with the method of
<a href="#interpolation">interpolation</a> comprise a palette.
Palettes can be named, saved, and later retrieved from the pulldown list 
indicated by the black inverted triangle near the top of the dialog.  
A built-in palette (<b>Chimera default</b> or any of the presets) cannot be 
overwritten or deleted, but it can be saved to a new name.
Custom palettes are saved in the Chimera
<a href="preferences.html#preffile"><b>preferences</b> file</a>, 
and are only updated with any changes
when <b>Save</b>, <b>Save As</b>, or <b>Delete</b> is used.
</p><p>
The <b>Help</b> button brings up this manual page in a browser window. 
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Palette Editor</b>.
