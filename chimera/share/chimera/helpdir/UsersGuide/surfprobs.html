<title>Surface Calculation Failures and Workarounds</title>
</head><body>
<h2>Surface Calculation Failures and Workarounds</h2>
<p>
<a href="representation.html#surfaces">Molecular surface</a> calculations
in Chimera (<b><A href="midas/surface.html">surface</A></b> command,
<A href="menu.html#actsurface"><b>Actions... Surface... show</b></a>
in the menu)
use the MSMS package and are subject to sporadic numerical failure.
These failures are not very predictable, except for a tendency to occur
more frequently for larger structures.
Failures may even vary from platform to platform 
due to small differences in rounding.
Surface calculation fails more often on Windows than on Mac and Linux.
</p><p>
One solution is to use the next-generation program
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/" target="_blank">ChimeraX</a>
instead of Chimera. It uses a different surface calculation method 
that is not subject to these failures, among other 
<a href="https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/advantages.html"
target="_blank">advantages</a>,
and like Chimera, it can be downloaded free of charge for noncommercial use.
</p><p>
The remainder of this page discusses workarounds in Chimera.
Unfortunately, how to avoid a failure in Chimera is not very predictable,
but anything that affects the surface shape (even quite subtly) may suffice.
</p><p>
The first thing to consider is whether the surface calculation has failed
completely, or whether the main component (generally enclosing the structure)
has been generated successfully and the failure only affects the
smaller components (generally interior bubbles).
If the surface of interest is shown and other components are
not needed for display or calculations, 
surface calculation error messages can be ignored. 
It is possible, however, for the calculation to proceed without error
messages but still generate localized defects such as interior bubbles 
poking through the outer surface.

<h3>Workarounds</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Subdividing the problem</b>.
The first two approaches involve breaking the problem into parts
to simplify the calculation:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>If the structure has multiple chains and it is acceptable to have
each chain enclosed in a separate surface, one can use the command
<a href="midas/split.html"><b>split</b></a> before trying to generate 
the surface. This command places the chains into different models. 
For example, if the structure is originally model #0,
it will become #0.1, #0.2, <i>etc.</i>, and in Chimera, 
different models give rise to different molecular surfaces.
Potential disadvantages of using
<a href="midas/split.html"><b>split</b></a>
are that previously saved <a href="midas/savepos.html">positions</a>
will cease to work, and any surface based on the original
model will not go away automatically.
<br><br>
<li>If breaking the problem into parts without splitting the model is
desired, one can use the command 
<a href="midas/surfcat.html"><b>surfcat</b></a> to tell Chimera exactly
which atoms should be grouped together into a surface.
With this method, saved <a href="midas/savepos.html">positions</a>
will continue to work, and any previous surfaces involving the same atoms
will go away automatically. The following encloses protein chain A in its
own molecular surface:
<blockquote>
<b><a href="midas/surfcat.html">surfcat</a> &nbsp;one &nbsp;:.a&protein</b>
<br>
<b><a href="midas/surface.html">surface</a> &nbsp;one</b>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<li><b>Adjusting molecular surface parameters</b>.
The next set of approaches subtly change the surface shape 
or triangulation process without changing the set of atoms to be enclosed:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="midas/vdwrad.html">VDW radii</a> of atoms can be
increased slightly, for example with the command:
<blockquote>
<b><a href="midas/vdwdefine.html">vdwdefine</a> &nbsp;+.01</b>
</blockquote>
This command also allows decreasing the radii, but increases are more likely
to circumvent the failure.
<br><br>
<li><a href="representation.html#surfaces">Molecular surface</a>
calculation parameters, namely <b>probe radius</b>
and <b>vertex density</b>, can be changed. They can be set at the time of
surface calculation with the <a href="midas/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a>
command, or prior to surface calculation in the 
<a href="preferences.html#New Surfaces"><b>New Surfaces</b> preferences</a>.
If the main component (disconnected part) has been calculated successfully, 
another approach is to <a href="selection.html">select</a> it and then use the
<a href="inspection.html"><b>Selection Inspector</b></a> to adjust the 
associated <a href="inspection.html#msmsprop"><b>MSMS surface</b>
parameters</a> after the fact.
The <b>show disjoint surfaces</b> setting controls whether Chimera will 
try to calculate all components instead of just one.
</ul>
<br>
<a name="alternatives"></a>
<li><b>Alternative kinds of surfaces</b>.
The last two possibilities generate surfaces that are not exactly the
(solvent-excluded) <a href="representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>,
but may suffice for visualization:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The command <a href="midas/molmap.html"><b>molmap</b></a> can be used
to simulate a density map of the atoms and display an isosurface, for example:
<blockquote>
<b><a href="midas/molmap.html">molmap</a> &nbsp;#0&protein &nbsp;4
&nbsp;gridSpacing &nbsp0.5</b>
</blockquote>
...where larger values of the &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; (4 in the example)
give a smoother but slightly larger surface.
<br><br>
<li><a href="../ContributedSoftware/multiscale/framemulti.html"
target="_top"><b>Multiscale Models</b></a> generates 
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/multiscale/multiscale.html#lowres">low-resolution surfaces</a>,
one per biopolymer chain. The surfaces are essentially smoothed isosurfaces
of atom occupancy, with <b>Resolution</b> adjustable in the dialog.
</ul>
<br>
Like molecular surfaces,
these alternative surfaces can be colored to match the underlying atoms (see
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/colorzone/colorzone.html"><b>Color Zone</b></a>
and <a href="midas/msc.html"><b>msc</b></a>)
or to show associated data such as electrostatic potential (see
<a href="../ContributedSoftware/surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Surface
Color</b></a> and <a href="midas/coulombic.html"><b>coulombic</b></a>
with the <a href="midas/coulombic.html#options"><b>atoms</b> option</a>).
<br><br>
<li><b>CPK representation</b>.
Displaying all atoms as VDW spheres also gives a 
space-filling representation of the molecule, 
albeit not smoothed like a surface. For example, commands:
<blockquote>
<b><a href="midas/ribbon.html">~ribbon</a>
<br>
<a href="midas/show.html">show</a> protein
<br>
<a href="midas/represent.html">repr</a> sphere protein
<br>
<a href="midas/color.html">color</a> tan</b>
</blockquote>
