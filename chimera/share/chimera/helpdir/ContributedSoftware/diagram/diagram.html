<p>
<b>Structure Diagram</b> generates 2D images of small organic molecules
using a web service provided by the
<a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/index.html" target="_blank">UCSF
Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics (RBVI)</a>.
This web service is implemented in Java using the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/"
target="_blank">Chemistry Development Kit</a>.
</p><p>
Use is only recommended for <b><i>small</i></b> organic molecules, on the
order of 50 or fewer nonhydrogen atoms.

<a href="../viewdock/framevd.html" target="_top"><b>ViewDock</b></a>,
using <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/open.html"><b>open</b></a> to 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/open.html#fetch">fetch</a> by 
SMILES string or PubChem CID.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Structure Diagram</b>, a tool in the <b>Utilities</b> category.
</p><p>
Information sent to the server can be a
<a href="https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html"
target="_blank"><b>SMILES</b></a> string or a 3D structure (<b>Molecule</b>) 
already open in Chimera.
Clicking <b>Apply</b> sends the information to the server and
displays the resulting 2D diagram (image in PNG format).
Hydrogen atoms are inferred by the server.
Image dimensions are set by the size of the <b>Structure Diagram</b>
dialog when <b>Apply</b> is clicked, and the
PNG file can be saved to disk with <b>Save</b>.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog, 
while <b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
