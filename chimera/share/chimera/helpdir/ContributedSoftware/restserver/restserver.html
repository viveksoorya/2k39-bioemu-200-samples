<h3>RESTServer <img src="resticon.png" alt="RESTServer icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>RESTServer</b> allows execution of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/framecommand.html" target="_top">Chimera commands</a>
through a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) interface.  See also:
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/listen.html"><b>listen</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/listen.html"><b>list</b></a>
</p>
<p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>RESTServer</b>, a tool in the <b>Utilities</b> category.
When <b>RESTServer</b> is started, it prints a message of the form
<pre>
REST server on host 127.0.0.1 port <i>port_number</i>
</pre>
If <b>RESTServer</b> is launched by specifying <b>--start</b>
on the Chimera command line, the output is sent to <i>stdout</i>;
this is particularly useful for programs that want to launch
and control Chimera programatically.
Requests may then be sent to Chimera via URLs that start with
<b>http://localhost:port_number/</b>.
Chimera supports two types of requests: predefined content
supplied by Chimera and command execution.
</p>
<p>
Predefined content may be accessed by appending the path in
the table below to the URL
<b>http://localhost:port_number/static/</b>:
<table cellpadding="5px" cellspacing="0px">
	<tr>
		<th>Path</th>
		<th>Content</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>cmdline.html</b></td>
		<td>An interface for executing commands in Chimera.
			Typically, this page is accessed from a browser;
			the user can type in commands
			and see the replies in the web page.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
To execute commands, requests should be sent to the URL
<b>http://localhost:port_number/run</b> with the Chimera
<a href="../../UsersGuide/framecommand.html" target="_top">commands</a>
encoded in one or more <b>command</b> parameters.
Chimera can process either
the GET or POST method in the HTTP request.
Messages resulting from the sequential execution of
these commands will be sent as <b>text/plain</b> reply
to the request instead of the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>
(although certain messages that require an answer will still raise a dialog).
</p>
<p>
<b>RESTServer</b> is designed as a replacement for
<a href="../readstdin/readstdin.html"><b>ReadStdin</b></a>.
<b>ReadStdin</b> is frequently used in conjunction with the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/listen.html"><b>listen</b></a>
command.  With both <b>ReadStdin</b> and <b>listen</b>
generating output to <i>stdout</i>, a program parsing
Chimera responses needs to demultiplex the output into
separate sources.
<b>RESTServer</b> uses its network connections strictly
for command execution and returning command output.
The <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/listen.html"><b>listen</b></a>
command has been augmented to take a <b>rest</b> option to send notification
messages to a REST server instead of the standard channels.
By using separate communication
channels for notification and command execution, a program
that controls Chimera remotely need not handle possibly mixed
output from different sources.
