<h3>Transform Coordinates
<img src="transformicon.png" alt="Transform Coordinates icon"></h3>
<p>
<b>Transform Coordinates</b> applies a specified 
rotation and translation to a model.
</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Transform Coordinates</b>, a tool in the <b>Movement</b> category.
</p><p>
The <b>Model</b> should be chosen from the list of open models.
Its transformation is specified with:
<ul>
<li><b>Euler angles [&phi; &theta; &psi;]</b> - rotations 
defined by the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerAngles.html"
target="_blank">&chi;-convention</a>,
where the first rotation is by an angle &phi; about the Z-axis,
the second is by an angle &theta; (potentially ranging from 0 to &pi;)
about the new X-axis, and the third is by an angle &psi; 
about the new Z-axis.
<br><br>
<li><b>Shift [<i>X Y Z</i>]</b> - translations along X, Y, and Z
</ul>
For a molecule model (atomic structure or
<a href="../volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html" target="_top">marker set</a>):
<ul>
<li><b>Move atoms instead of coordinate axes</b> - 
whether to change the atomic coordinates of the model rather than its
transformation matrix
</ul>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> performs the rotation and translation.
The cumulative change from the original transformation 
is reported in the dialog.
<b>Reset</b> restores the original transformation.
<b>Set</b> is equivalent to clicking <b>Reset</b> and then <b>Apply</b>.
</p><p>
Cumulative change information and original coordinates
are not retained in saved
