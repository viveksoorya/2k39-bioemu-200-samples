<h3>Coulombic Surface Coloring <img src="coulombicon.png"
alt="Coulombic Surface Coloring icon"></h3>

<p>
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b> 
calculates electrostatic potential according to Coulomb's law:
<blockquote>
<font size ="+1">
&phi; = &Sigma; [q<sub>i</sub> / (&epsilon;d<sub>i</sub>)]
</font>
</blockquote>
&phi; is the potential (which varies in space),
q are the atomic partial charges,
d are the distances from the atoms, and
&epsilon; is the dielectric, representing screening by the medium or solvent.
A distance-dependent dielectric (&epsilon; = <i>C</i>d where <i>C</i> is some 
constant) is sometimes used to approximate screening by implicit solvent.
</p><p>
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b> colors 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surfaces</a>
by the potential values and can handle structures with or
without explicit <a href="#hydrogens">hydrogens</a>.  It can also
<a href="#volume">generate a grid</a> of the potential values.
</p><p>
Whereas <b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b> can only color
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surfaces</a>
based on the charges of the residues they enclose,
the <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/coulombic.html"><b>coulombic</b></a>
command has an option to use the charges of an arbitrary set of atoms.
This allows coloring the surface of one molecule by the potential from another,
for example, or coloring nonmolecular surfaces such as density isosurfaces.
</p><p>
The
<a href="../surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b></a>
tool is similar, but uses a previously computed
<a href="../../UsersGuide/filetypes.html#esp">electrostatic potential grid</a>.
The grid could be from <b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b> or from
any of several separate (not included with Chimera)
programs that solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
Chimera does include interfaces to such programs: 
<a href="../delphicontroller/delphicontroller.html"><b>DelPhiController</b></a>
requires a local (user-installed) copy of 
<a href="http://compbio.clemson.edu/delphi" target="_blank">DelPhi</a>,
and the <a href="../apbs/apbs.html"><b>APBS</b></a> tool can use either
a web service or a locally installed copy of 
<a href="https://www.poissonboltzmann.org" target="_blank">APBS</a>
(Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver).
</p><p>
Poisson-Boltzmann calculations are more complex and, if done correctly,
more accurate than simple Coulomb's law approaches.
However, a Coulombic potential may suffice for visualization.
(See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mzopva" 
target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/mzopva </a>
for an informal comparison of images made in Chimera using
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b>
with published figures of Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic potential.)

</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b>, a tool
in the <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> category.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/coulombic.html"><b>coulombic</b></a>.
</p><p>
The 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface(s)</a>
should first be displayed (using <b>Actions... Surface... show</b>
or the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/surface.html"><b>surface</b></a>)
and then chosen from the list of <b>Surfaces to color by ESP</b>. 
Only the residues enclosed by a surface will be used
to calculate the potential on that surface.
For example, nearby ions, solvent, or ligand molecules will not affect
the results for a surface that encloses only protein.  <b>Coulombic Surface
Coloring</b> does not show the potential from one molecule on the surface
of another, although that can be done in an additional step after 
<a href="#volume">generating a grid</a>.
</p><p>
Parameters:
<ul>
<li><b>Number of colors/values</b> 
(default <b>3</b>: <b>red</b>, <b>white</b>, and <b>blue</b>)
- up to 11 pairs can be used. 
Each color can be adjusted by clicking its 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a> and 
using the <a href="../../UsersGuide/colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>.
The values can be edited directly, and are in units of
kcal/(mol&middot;<i>e</i>) at 298 K.
<!--
Eric: potentials calculated with proton charge units and Angstroms
get scaled by a factor of 331.62, which according to the midas
esp source code converts them to "Kcals energy units". 
ECM: I believe it is actually kcal/mol per proton charge at 25C = 298K.
Note DelPhi ESP is in kT/e and 1 kT = 0.593 kcal/mol at 298 K.
-->
<p>
The specified color/value pairs or thresholds define a color mapping.
The value calculated for each surface vertex will be compared to the thresholds.
Surface vertices with values lower than any threshold will be assigned the 
color of the lowest-value threshold, while vertices with values higher than
any threshold will be assigned the color of the highest-value threshold.  
The colors of the remaining vertices will be obtained by linear 
interpolation between the nearest lower and higher thresholds.
Finally, each surface triangle will be colored by linearly interpolating
its vertex colors.
Colors are defined by red, green, blue, and opacity/transparency components. 
</p>
<li><b>Distance-dependent dielectric</b> (<b>true</b>/false) 
- whether &epsilon; should vary in proportion to the distance from each charge
<li><b>Dielectric constant</b> (default <b>4.0</b>)
- value of <i>C</i>, where &epsilon; = <i>C</i>d if distance-dependent,
&epsilon; = <i>C</i> if not distance-dependent
<li><b>Distance from surface</b> (default <b>1.4</b> &Aring;)
- how far out from each surface vertex, along its normal,
to evaluate the electrostatic potential.  The rationale for looking outward
is that the values at the centers of any interacting atoms are more relevant
than those at their surfaces.  A 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
is <b><i>solvent-excluded</i></b>; it shows where the surface of a 
spherical probe (typically of radius 1.4 &Aring;) can lie.  Thus, 1.4 &Aring; 
out from the molecular surface is about as close as the probe center
can get, the <b><i>solvent-accessible</i></b> surface.
</ul>
<a name="hisprot">
The <b>Implicit Histidine Protonation</b> section controls the charge states
of histidines in structures without hydrogens.</a>
Although hydrogens will not be added explicitly, the implicit 
protonation states will affect the results because the charges differ
throughout the residue for different
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#alterstates">protonation states</a>,
and the charges of the implicit hydrogens will be merged 
with those of the attached heavy atoms.
<ul>
<li><b>Residue name-based</b>
- residue names will be used to determine which histidine sidechain 
nitrogens should be implicitly protonated: the &delta;-nitrogen
in residues named HID, the &epsilon;-nitrogen in HIE, and both 
nitrogens in HIP.  
The <b>HIS =</b> setting specifies how residues with the standard histidine
name (HIS) should be treated:
  <ul>
  <li><b>estimated from H-bonds</b> (default) 
  - choose protonation state based on local H-bonding environment
  <li><b>delta</b> 
  - neutral sidechain, implicit hydrogen at &delta;-nitrogen
  <li><b>epsilon</b> 
  - neutral sidechain, implicit hydrogen at &epsilon;-nitrogen
  <li><b>both</b>
   - positive sidechain, implicitly protonated at both sidechain nitrogens
  </ul>
<li><b>Specified individually...</b> 
the desired protonation state of each histidine residue
will be specified with checkboxes in the dialog
</ul>
Turning on <a name="computegrid"><b>Compute grid...</b></a>
reveals additional options for for generating a three-dimensional grid 
of the values (see <a href="#volume">why this might be useful</a>):
<ul>
<li><b>Grid spacing</b> (default <b>1.0</b> &Aring;) - grid resolution;
separation of grid points along X, Y, and Z
<li><b>Padding</b> (default <b>5.0</b> &Aring;) - how far to extend
the grid box in every direction from the minimum needed to enclose the atoms
<li><b>Volume name</b> (default <b>Coulombic ESP</b>) - dataset name 
</ul>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> (or <b>OK</b>, which also dismisses the dialog)
calculates the electrostatic potential and applies the coloring.
</p><p>
<b>Create corresponding color key</b> opens the
<a href="../2dlabels/2dlabels.html#colorkey"><b>Color Key</b></a> dialog
and populates it with the current colors and values;
a color key can then be created interactively with the mouse.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> simply dismisses the dialog, while
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
</p>

<a name="volume">
<h4>GENERATING VOLUME DATA</h4></a>
<p>
The <a href="#computegrid"><b>Compute grid...</b></a> option generates a grid
of the electrostatic potential values (a volume dataset)
and starts the
<a href="../surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b></a>
and
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume
Viewer</b></a> tools.  This allows:
<ul>
<li>showing the Coulombic potential from one molecule on the surface of
a different molecule, or on a nonmolecular
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface model</a>
<li>coloring planar <a href="../surfcapper/surfcapper.html">caps</a>
where surfaces are <a href="../../UsersGuide/clipping.html">clipped</a>
<li>showing the potential as isosurfaces (however, this is
generally less useful for Coulombic than for Poisson-Boltzmann ESP)
<li>saving the grid to a file for later use
</ul>
The first two of these tasks can be accomplished using
<a href="../surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b></a>
(or <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/scolor.html"><b>scolor</b></a>), 
the latter two with 
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" target="_top"><b>Volume
Viewer</b></a> (or 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/volume.html"><b>volume</b></a>).
</p>

<a name="hydrogens">
<h4>HYDROGENS AND CHARGES</h4></a>
<p>
The Coulombic potential calculation requires charge assignments,
which in turn require hydrogens.
An existing structure lacking hydrogens is not changed, 
but a copy is created in memory, <a href="../addh/addh.html">protonated</a>,
and <a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html">assigned charges</a>
(<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#standard">details</a>),
which are then transferred to the existing structure.
Selenomethionine (MSE) residues are treated as methionines (MET)
for purposes of charge assignment.  Where hydrogens
are missing from the existing structure,
their charges are collapsed onto the adjacent heavy atom: such hydrogens
are <i>implicit</i>.
</p><p>
A structure may already have <i>explicit</i> hydrogens, or they can be added
beforehand in Chimera with <a href="../addh/addh.html"><b>AddH</b></a>.
A structure may also have pre-existing charge assignments, from prior use of
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html"><b>Add Charge</b></a>,
<a href="../apbs/pdb2pqr.html"><b>PDB2PQR</b></a>, or
<b>Coulombic Surface Coloring</b>, or
<a href="../addcharge/addcharge.html#input">read from a file</a>.
If all of the atoms corresponding to the chosen surface already have
charges, those values will be used rather than assigned anew 
the first time Coulombic coloring is applied to that surface.
In subsequent applications, the existing charges will be used unless
a setting in the
<a href="#hisprot"><b>Implicit Histidine Protonation</b></a> section 
is changed, which forces the charges to be assigned anew.
Another way to force reassignment is to remove the charges with the command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/setattr.html"><b>~setattr a charge</b></a>.
</p><p>
While implicit hydrogens are appropriate for most uses, 
collapsing the hydrogen charges onto the adjacent heavy atoms 
tends to decrease positive potential magnitudes at the surface.
This usually has little effect on the qualitative picture, 
but if it is of concern, the structure can be 
<a href="../addh/addh.html">protonated</a> beforehand.
A disadvantage of explicit hydrogens, however,
is that they make surfaces more rugged (bumpier) and complicated to view.
To circumvent this problem, one could add first add hydrogens, then
<a href="#volume">generate a grid</a> of the Coulombic potential values,
then delete the hydrogens to make the molecular surface less rugged
(or show the surface for a separate copy of the structure that does not
have hydrogens), and finally, color that surface with
<a href="../surfcolor/surfcolor.html"><b>Electrostatic Surface Coloring</b></a>
using the Coulombic grid 
that had been generated in the presence of hydrogens.
</p>

<a name="limitations">
<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4></a>
<p>
<b>Subsequent coloring operations may erase surface custom colors</b>. 
Unless explicitly limited to non-surface items, subsequent use of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/menu.html#actcolor"><b>Actions... Color</b></a>
or the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/color.html"><b>color</b></a>
on the molecule model corresponding to a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#surfaces">molecular surface</a>
will reset the surface's color source to <b>atoms</b> and wipe out 
the Coulombic potential colors.  The custom surface coloring
will be erased even when only parts of the molecule model 
that do not contribute to the molecular surface are recolored.
</p>
<p>
<b>Subsequent recomputation of the molecular surface erases custom colors</b>. 
Anything that triggers surface recalculation, 
such as deleting atoms from the molecule model or changing certain 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/msmsattrib.html">molecular surface parameters</a>, 
will erase the Coulombic potential colors.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Surface caps not colored</b>.
This tool does not color
<a href="../surfcapper/surfcapper.html">caps</a>
on <a href="../../UsersGuide/clipping.html">clipped</a> surfaces,
but it can be done in an additional step after 
<a href="#volume">generating a grid</a>.
