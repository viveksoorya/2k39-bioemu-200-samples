<b>PipesAndPlanks</b> creates a VRML model of a protein 
in which helices are shown as &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; (cylinders), 
strands as &ldquo;planks&rdquo; (rectangular boxes), and the remaining
coil as thin connectors. 
Arrowheads can be included to indicate chain directionality.
Pipes and planks are only generated for proteins;
helix and strand assignments are taken from the input structure
file or generated with
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/ksdssp.html"><b>ksdssp</b></a>.

There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>PipesAndPlanks</b>, a tool in the <b>Depiction</b> category.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/pipes.html"><b>pipes</b></a>.
</p><p>
The model of interest should be chosen from the pulldown list
of open molecule models (indicated by the black inverted triangle near
the top of the dialog).
</p><p>
<b>Helix color</b>, <b>Strand color</b>, and <b>Coil color</b> assignments 
(default <b>No Color</b>) can be changed by clicking the respective 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell">color well</a>
and using the <a href="../../UsersGuide/colortool.html"><b>Color Editor</b></a>.
A <b>No Color</b> setting indicates that
each pipe, plank, or stretch of coil should be colored using the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/hierarchy.html#coloring">residue color</a>
(ribbon color) of its first residue.  If a protein chain
had been <a href="../rainbow/rainbow.html">rainbow-colored</a> from 
N-terminus to C-terminus, for example, each secondary structure element 
would be shown with a different color in the rainbow range.
</p><p>
<b>Helix edge color</b>, <b>Strand edge color</b>, and <b>Coil edge color</b> 
are set to <b>No Color</b> by default; if set to a color, outlines in that
color will be drawn for the corresponding part.
These outlines may be useful in addition to standard
<a href="../../UsersGuide/print.html#silhouettes">silhouettes</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Helix radius</b>, <b>Strand width</b>, <b>Strand thickness</b>,
<b>Coil width</b>, and <b>Coil thickness</b> default to fixed values of
<b>1.25</b>, <b>2.5</b>, <b>1.0</b>, <b>0.25</b>, and <b>0.25</b> &Aring, 
respectively.  If <b>Fixed</b> [<b>helix radius</b>, <b>strand width</b>, 
or <b>strand thickness</b>] is instead set to <b>false</b>,
the specified value is ignored and the parameter instead depends on
the distances from the constituent &alpha;-carbons to the axis of the helix
or strand.  If the ratio of maximum to minimum distance from &alpha;-carbons
to the axis exceeds the [<b>Helix</b> or <b>Strand</b>] <b>split threshold</b> 
(and the corresponding <b>Split curved...</b> option is <b>true</b>), 
the pipe or plank will be split into two or more parts.
</p><p>
<b>Show arrow on helix</b> and <b>Show arrow on strand</b> (both default
<b>true</b>) place arrowheads on the C-terminal ends of secondary structure
elements to indicate N&rarr;C directionality.
</p><p>
Depiction of coils can be turned off by setting 
<b>Display coil</b> to <b>false</b>.
<b>Coil subdivisions</b> (default <b>10</b>) refers to the number of segments
per residue used to represent coils.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>OK</b> creates the display and dismisses the dialog;
clicking <b>Apply</b> creates the display without dismissing the dialog.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog, and
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
The pipes-and-planks VRML model is assigned the same model number
as the corresponding molecule.  
The original model will still be shown; one may wish to undisplay its
<a href="../../UsersGuide/representation.html#ribbon">ribbons</a>
or to hide it entirely using the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>.
The VRML model can also be hidden, shown, or closed
with the <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>.
