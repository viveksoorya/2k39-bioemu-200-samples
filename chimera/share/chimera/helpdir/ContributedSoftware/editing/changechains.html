<h3>Change Chain IDs <img src="changechains-icon.png" 
alt="Change Chain IDs icon"></h3>
<p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Change Chain IDs</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b> category.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/changechains.html"><b>changechains</b></a>.
See also: 
<a href="editing.html"><b>Build Structure</b></a>,
<a href="renumber.html"><b>Renumber Residues</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/savemodel.html">modifying and saving data</a>
</p><p>
The chain(s) to be assigned new identifiers (chain IDs)
should be chosen from the list.
For each chosen chain, an entry box will be supplied for the new ID,
where case is important.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> or <b>OK</b> (which also dismisses the dialog)
reassigns chain IDs as indicated, if possible.  If the reassignment
would give one or more duplicate residue numbers within a chain,
an error message will appear and the reassignment will not occur.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog; <b>Help</b>
opens this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
<b>Handling multiple chains with the same ID</b>.
Multiple chains with the same character ID present a problem because 
the dialog lists them as a single chain.  However, if the ID is blank,
disconnected chains will be detected and listed separately.
Thus, the workaround is to:
<ol>
<li>assign them (collectively) a blank ID, <i>i.e.</i>,
enter a space character and click <b>Apply</b>
<li>assign unique IDs to the chains, now listed separately
</ol>
