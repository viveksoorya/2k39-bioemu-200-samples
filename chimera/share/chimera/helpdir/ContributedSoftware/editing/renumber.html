<p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Renumber Residues</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Editing</b> category.
It is also implemented as the command
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/resrenumber.html"><b>resrenumber</b></a>.
See also: 
<a href="editing.html"><b>Build Structure</b></a>,
<a href="changechains.html"><b>Change Chain IDs</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/savemodel.html">modifying and saving data</a>
</p><p>
The residues to renumber can be indicated as:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>selected residues</b> - all residues containing any 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> atoms
<li><b>chains</b> - all residues in chain(s) chosen from the list
</ul>
<p>
The indicated residues from <i>each</i> chain
will be renumbered <b>starting from</b> the entered integer.
In other words, numbering will start over for each chain rather than
incrementing from the previous chain.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Apply</b> or <b>OK</b> (which also dismisses the dialog)
applies the renumbering, if possible.  If the renumbering
would produce one or more duplicate residue numbers within a 
chain, an error message will appear and the numbering will not be applied.
<p>
<b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog; <b>Help</b>
opens this manual page in a browser window.
