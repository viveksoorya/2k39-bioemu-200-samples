<h3><a name="method">Methodology</a></h3>
<p>
<b>Segger</b> performs <b><i>watershed segmentation</i></b>:
a density map is partitioned so that each local maximum has its 
own region, and the boundaries between regions lie at the
valleys between the local maxima.  The goal is usually
one region per protein or domain, but the initial segmentation 
often gives more numerous and smaller regions than desired, 
especially if the data are noisy.  
<a name="grouping">
Segger provides various ways to combine regions after the initial segmentation:
</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#options">automatic grouping</a>
 by <b><i>scale-space filtering</i></b> 
(smoothing the data), done by default
<li>interactive grouping <a href="#byhand">by manual selection</a>
<li>interactive grouping <a href="#byconnectivity">by connectivity</a>
<li>interactive grouping using fitted molecules
</ul>
However, it may also be necessary to smooth the data <i>before</i>
segmentation, as discussed <a href="#preprocessing">below</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="preprocessing">Data Size and Preprocessing</a></h3>
<p>
For working with large density maps (> 500 Mbytes), a 64-bit version of Chimera 
and a machine with more than 4 Gbytes of memory are recommended.
</p><p>
It may be necessary to process a density map beforehand
to allow segmentation to finish in a reasonable amount of time.
Maps of size 256<sup>3</sup> with grid spacing about 1/3 of the map resolution 
are manageable on desktop computers circa 2010, 
while larger maps may require smoothing and binning.  
Calculation of 100,000 watershed regions is reasonable, 
but calculation of a million is unusably slow.  A map of size 
256<sup>3</sup> can easily have a million local maxima if it is noisy.
Gaussian filtering and binning to reduce the number of local maxima
can be performed with 
<a href="../volumeviewer/gaussian.html"><b>Volume Filter</b></a>
or the command <a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/vop.html"><b>vop</b></a>.
Gaussian filtering reduces resolution to about six times the Gaussian
standard deviation.  For visualization and analysis, it is desirable
for a density map to be oversampled by three times in each dimension, 
so binning should aim for a grid spacing of approximately twice the 
Gaussian standard deviation.
</p><p>
If interactive rotation speed is poor after segmentation, see
<a href="#response">response time issues</a>.
</p>

<a name="dialog"><h3>Dialog and Basic Usage</h3></a>
<p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Segger</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
<a name="chosenmap">
The map of interest should be chosen from the pulldown menu of
open volume data sets next to <b>Segment map</b>. 
</a>
The threshold (contour level) of the map in 
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a> should be adjusted
before segmentation, because the calculation will use only the voxels
with density values above that level.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Segment</b> partitions the chosen map by the watershed method plus
smoothing and grouping as specified in the <a href="#options">options</a>. 
The segmentation result is shown as a
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface model</a> 
with one or more <b><i>segmentation regions</i></b> (specialized
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfpiecedef">surface pieces</a>) 
of different colors.  The resulting number of regions is reported in the 
dialog and the <a href="../../UsersGuide/reply.html"><b>Reply Log</b></a>.
The segmentation is given the same name as the corresponding map except
with <b>.seg</b> appended. 
</p><p>
<a name="currseg">
The <b>Current segmentation</b> is indicated in the dialog and can be changed
by choosing a different segmentation name from the pulldown menu.
Designating a segmentation as the current segmentation
shows it and hides any others.
</a>
Grouping and ungrouping operations modify
the current segmentation model rather than creating a new one. 
However, multiple segmentation models can be open at the same time, 
and may have been generated from different density maps or opened from
previously <a href="#menu-file">saved</a> segmentation files.
</p><p>
<a name="byhand">Grouping and ungrouping</a> can be specified interactively
by <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selection</a>.  With default
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>,
Ctrl-click selects a region and Shift-Ctrl-click selects additional regions
without erasing the pre-existing selection.
<ul>
<li>If no segmentation regions are selected,
clicking <b>Ungroup</b> backtracks to the previous stage of grouping of the
<a href="#currseg">current segmentation</a>.
By default, <b>Segment</b> automatically applies three rounds of smoothing 
and grouping; after that, the three intermediate stages could be accessed 
by clicking <b>Ungroup</b> three times.  If regions are selected,
<b>Ungroup</b> will backtrack to the previous stage of grouping for
the selected region(s).
<li>If no segmentation regions are selected,
<b>Group</b> traverses the stages in the opposite direction as <b>Ungroup</b>,
or performs further grouping.
If regions are selected,
<b>Group</b> will combine the selected regions into a single group.
</ul>
Grouping, ungrouping, and other manipulations can also be performed with the
<b>Segger</b> <a href="#menu-regions"><b>Regions</b> menu</a>.
Segmentation results are not included in saved Chimera
<a href="../../UsersGuide/sessions.html#sesdef">sessions</a>,
but can be saved using the <b>Segger</b> 
<a href="#menu-file"><b>File</b> menu</a>.
<b>Close</b> dismisses the <b>Segger</b> dialog. 
<b>Help</b> shows documentation in a browser window.
</p><p>
<a name="options">Clicking <b>Options</b></a> reveals additional settings
(clicking the close button <img src ="../volumeviewer/x.png"> on the right
hides them again):
<ul>
<li><b>Smoothing steps [<i>N</i>] step size [<i>M</i>] voxels</b>
- how many rounds of automatic smoothing and grouping 
(default <i>N</i>=<b>3</b>)
should be performed right after watershed segmentation 
when the <b>Segment</b> button is clicked,
and how much smoothing to perform at each round
(default <i>M</i>=<b>1</b>).  
If <i>L</i> is the minimum of the grid spacing along the three axes,
the standard deviation of the Gaussian used for smoothing
will be <i>M</i>x<i>L</i> in the first round and increase
by <i>M</i>x<i>L</i> in each subsequent round.
A single round consists of smoothing the data, then letting each 
local maximum point from the previous round move by steepest ascent 
to the location of a new local maximum.
If two or more previous maxima converge on a new maximum,
their regions from the previous round are coalesced into a single region.
In general, the number of rounds <i>N</i> is the dominant parameter to adjust
when fewer, larger regions are desired.  A larger step size <i>M</i> may be 
beneficial for noisier maps.  However, a smaller step size gives more gradual 
changes per round, thus more rounds to achieve a similar end result, and more 
intermediate stages that can be traversed with the
<b>Group</b> and <b>Ungroup</b> buttons.  
After the automatic rounds have completed, clicking <b>Group</b>
executes the minimum number of additional rounds needed to
change the grouping further.
<br><br>
<li><b>Keep only regions having at least [<i>minsize</i>] voxels</b>
- throw out regions with fewer than <i>minsize</i> voxels (default <b>1</b>,
retaining all regions).  This applies only to the initial segmentation,
not after smoothing.
<br><br>
<li><b>Stop grouping if number of regions <= [<i>minreg</i>]</b>
- backtrack to the previous stage of automatic grouping if the latest
round would give fewer than <i>minreg</i> regions (default <b>1</b>).
This is useful for generating a segmentation with no fewer regions
than the known or suspected number of components in a complex.
<br><br>
<li><a name="maxreg"><b>Display at most [<i>maxreg</i>] regions</b></a>
- to avoid degrading performance, limit the number of displayed regions
to <i>maxreg</i> (default <b>2000</b>).  
If a greater number of regions is generated, however,
those which are not displayed will still be included in
subsequent smoothing and grouping calculations.  
If <a href="#response">response time</a> is poor when a high number
(approaching <i>maxreg</i>) of regions is shown,
decreasing <i>maxreg</i> may help.
<br><br>
<li><a name="granularity"><b>Surface granularity 
[<i>trianglesize</i>] voxels</b></a>
- surfaces consist of triangles; smaller triangles give a smoother appearance,
but more triangles take longer to render.  The default <i>trianglesize</i> 
of <b>1</b> gives triangles comparable in size to the map grid spacing.  
A value of 2 will make the triangles twice as large (quadruple the area) 
and reduce their number by about a factor of 4.  Increasing
<i>trianglesize</i> is recommended if <a href="#response">response time</a>
is poor.
<br><br>
<li><a name="byconnectivity"><b>Group with mouse [<i>button</i>]</b></a>
allows grouping watershed regions connected 
at some density level, controlled interactively by mouse drag.
Activating this option reassigns the indicated mouse button
(which can be changed using the pulldown menu) from its normal function in the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Mouse"><b>Mouse</b> preferences</a>
to grouping by connectivity.
If the density map has not been segmented already,
the initial click on the map with the assigned button 
performs watershed segmentation using only the voxels with density values above
the current threshold setting in
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>, without subsequent smoothing/grouping.
If grouping has already been performed, 
some ungrouping may be needed before using the connectivity method, 
as it will not group watershed regions together if they are already 
in different groups.
Watershed regions continuous with the clicked density are grouped and
shown in the same color.  The level of density used 
to determine connectivity can be adjusted by mouse drag.
Clicking a watershed region with the assigned button and dragging up (down)
shows what regions would be continuous with the first at more (less) 
permissive density cutoffs.  The coloring updates automatically:
regions that would be connected are shown in the same
color as the first, and unconnected but adjacent regions are shown
in their own group colors, or if not grouped, in gray.
The group being adjusted with the mouse 
will not extend into a pre-existing group.
Releasing the mouse button groups the matching-color regions.
Clicking with the assigned button on the background 
displays all of the ungrouped watershed regions
in the <a href="#currseg">current segmentation</a>,
and clicking again displays the grouped ones as well.
Any previously created group can be adjusted by clicking
one of its constituent watershed regions with the assigned button
and dragging as described above.
</ul>
</p><p>
<a name="shortcuts">Clicking <b>Shortcuts</b></a> reveals several buttons
for quickly displaying, selecting, and acting upon selected 
segmentation regions.
There are also buttons for calling separate dialogs:
<ul>
<li><b>Fit</b> - <a href="fitsegments.html"><b>SegFit</b></a>
<li><b>Extract</b> - detailed options for extracting densities within
the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> regions
<li><b>rSeg</b> - radial segmentation
<li><b>SegLoop</b> - basic atomic structure modeling into regions
<li><b>ProMod</b> - combining multiple atomic models into a probabilistic model
</ul>
Clicking the close button <img src ="../volumeviewer/x.png"> on the right
hides the shortcut buttons.
</p>

<a name="attributes"><h3>Segmentation Region Attributes</h3></a>
<p>
Segmenting a map generates <a href="#top">segmentation regions</a> and 
automatically assigns them several
<a href="../defineattrib/defineattrib.html#attribdef">attributes</a>.
These attributes can be inspected and new attributes assigned
using the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog, opened by choosing <b>Regions...
Attributes table</b> from the <a href="#menu"><b>Segger</b> menu</a>.
Segmentation regions can be colored or
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> 
based on their attribute values using the
<a href="../render/render.html"><b>Render/Select by Attribute</b></a> tool.
See also:
<a href="../defineattrib/defineattrib.html"><b>Define Attribute</b></a>,
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/measure.html#spine"><b>measure spine</b></a>
</p><p>
In the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog,
each row is a region, and each column is an attribute that can be 
shown or hidden using the <b>Columns</b> menu.
The table can be sorted by the values in any displayed column by
clicking the column header.  Clicking the header once sorts the entries
in order of increasing value and places an up arrowhead (triangle)
in the header.  Clicking again sorts the entries in decreasing
order and places a down arrowhead (inverted triangle) in the header.
</p><p>
<a name="chosen">
One or more regions (rows) in the table 
can be chosen with the left mouse button.</a>
A contiguous block of rows can be chosen by dragging, or by
clicking on the first (or last) line and then <b>Shift</b>-clicking on the
last (or first).  <b>Ctrl</b>-click toggles the status of a single line.  
Choosing a region in the table
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a> it, and
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selecting</a> a region in the
graphics window will center and highlight the corresponding row in the table.
</p><p>
The automatically created attributes are read-only:
<ul>
<li><b>region</b> - region ID number
<li><b>grid points</b> - number of density map grid points within the region
<li><b>grouped</b> - number of regions grouped to form the region
(next level in hierarchy, not necessarily the number of watershed regions)
<li><b>has surface</b> - 1 if a surface has been made (not necessarily shown)
for the region
<li><b>contacts</b> - number of contacting regions
<li><b>edge distance</b> - number of voxels to the nearest edge
of the density map
<li><b>bounds</b> (hidden by default) - grid indices bounding the region: 
i_min, j_min, k_min, i_max, j_max, k_max
</ul>
New attributes for the chosen region(s)
can be created or their values changed using:
<ul>
<li><b>Set attribute</b> [<i>attr_name</i>] <b>to value</b> [<i>attr_value</i>]
<b>or</b> [<b>snapshot</b>]
</ul>
Region attribute values can be integers,
floating point numbers, text strings, or images, and a given attribute
(column) can have multiple types of values, although only one per region (row).
An <i>attr_value</i> can be entered, or the
<b>snapshot</b> button clicked to set the value to an image of the
graphics window.  An image can be shown at full size by
clicking its miniature version in the table, and saved as PNG, JPEG, or TIFF
using the <b>Save</b> button on the full-size view.
</p><p>
The table can filtered to show only the rows meeting some attribute criterion:
<ul>
<li><b>Filter list</b> [<i>criterion</i>]
</ul>
The <i>criterion</i> is specified in Python syntax.  Examples:
<blockquote>
grid_points &gt; 1500
<br>
note
<br>
contacts == 0 and note and "good" in note
</blockquote>
where the second would list only regions with an attribute named <b>note</b>
and the third would list only regions that are not in contact with other regions
and that have an attribute named <b>note</b> containing the word <b>good</b>.
</p><p>
Clicking <b>Update</b> refreshes the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog 
to reflect any changes in the <a href="#currseg">current segmentation</a> 
or its groupings.  <b>Close</b> dismisses the dialog, and <b>Help</b> shows
this manual page in a browser window.
</p><p>
The contents (excluding images) of the rows and columns currently shown 
in the filtered table can be saved in a comma-separated format using
<b>File... Export</b> in the <b>Region Attributes</b> dialog menu.
All of the attributes (including images) 
can be saved along with other segmentation information 
using <b>File... Save Segmentation</b>

<a name="response"><h3>Response Time Issues</h3></a>
<p>
<b>High number of surface triangles</b>.
Surfaces are drawn as many small triangles.
The number of surface triangles can be reduced by increasing the
<a href="#granularity">granularity</a> (triangle size).
Doubling the value will reduce the number of triangles by approximately
a factor of 4 and may improve rendering speed by a similar factor.
Also, the display can be limited to a specified
<a href="#maxreg">maximum number of regions</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Selected surfaces</b>.  
Chimera shows <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selections</a> with
a green outline (assuming default 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Selection"><b>Selection</b>
preferences</a>).  Selection outlines can increase the time to draw a 
single frame as much as fivefold.  If rotation is slow, avoid having
objects selected when the selection is not needed.
</p><p>
<b>Mac graphics speed</b>. 
Rendering many small segmentation surfaces on Mac OS 10.6 is about three
times slower than on other platforms (Linux, Windows). As mentioned above, 
the display can be limited to a specified 
<a href="#maxreg">maximum number of regions</a>.
Also, increasing the <a href="#granularity">surface granularity</a>
will improve rendering speed. 
The poor performance on the Mac is because Chimera has disabled use of 
the fast rendering technique of OpenGL vertex buffer objects for small 
surfaces, as it causes minute-long freezes on the Mac when over 5000 
segmentation surfaces are shown.
