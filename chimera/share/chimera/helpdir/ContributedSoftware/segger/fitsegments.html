There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>SegFit</b>, a tool in the <b>Volume Data</b> category
(including from the
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html" 
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<b>Tools</b> menu).
</p><p>
The <b>Structure or Map to fit</b> 
should be chosen from the pulldown menu of models. 
It can be a density map or a molecule model (atomic structure).
Any atoms in the molecule model that are not desired for fitting,
such as solvent or extra chains, should be
<a href="../editing/editing.html#deletion">deleted</a> 
before the fitting is done. 
</p><p>
Clicking the <b>Fit</b> button at the bottom of the dialog performs the fitting.
The default <a href="#options">settings</a> are to fit the structure
to the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> regions
using the principal axes method. The regions are made transparent;
region transparency/opacity can be adjusted further using
<a href="segment.html"><b>Segger</b></a> or the main Chimera menu
<a href="../../UsersGuide/menu.html#actsurface"><b>Actions... Surface</b></a>.
</p><p>
<a name="table">Fit information is shown in a table</a>:
<ul>
<li><a name="corr"><b>Corr</b></a>
- the <a href="../fitmaps/fitmaps.html#correlation">correlation</a>,
also known as the <b><i>cross-correlation score</i></b>,
between the map that was segmented (the fitting target) and the map to fit
(either specified directly or 
<a href="#molmap">generated from the atomic structure</a>)
<li><b>At Incl</b> - atom inclusion,
fraction of atoms within the target map contour;
an atom is within the contour if its position in the map has a
density value above the current threshold setting in
<a href="../volumeviewer/framevolumeviewer.html"
target="_top"><b>Volume Viewer</b></a>
<li><b>BB Incl</b> - backbone-atom inclusion,
fraction of backbone atoms within the target map contour
<li><b>Clashes</b> - fraction of atoms clashing with symmetry copies
(if <a href="#clashes">clashes</a> are being evaluated)
<li><b>Dens Occ</b> - density occupancy, fraction of voxels within
the target <a href="segment.html">segmentation region(s)</a>
<!-- (and target map contour) ?? -->
occupied by at least one atom of the fit structure
<li><b>Molecule</b> - the fit structure, either a molecule model or a map
<li><b>Map</b> - the fitting target, the map from which the
<a href="segment.html">segmentation region(s)</a> were derived
<li><b>Region</b> - the <a href="segment.html">segmentation region(s)</a> used
for fitting
</ul>
<a name="chosenfit">
One or more rows (fits) can be <b><i>chosen</i></b> with the mouse. 
</a>
The structure is repositioned as each fit is chosen.
The chosen fit(s) can be saved to files or removed from the table using
the <b>SegFit</b> <a href="#menu">menu</a>.
</p>
<a name="options">Clicking <b>Options</b></a> reveals additional settings
(clicking the close button <img src ="../volumeviewer/x.png"> on the right
hides them again):
<ul>
<li><b>Treat all sub-models as one structure</b> - whether to fit
<a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html#multimodel">submodels</a>
with the same main model number (#2.1, #2.2, <i>etc.</i>) 
collectively as a single structure instead of separately
<br><br>
<li style="list-style-type:none"><a name="molmap"><b>Density map resolution 
[<i>r</i>] grid spacing [<i>s</i>]</b></a>
- set parameters for generating a density map from the atomic structure,
to allow calculating <a href="#corr">correlation</a> values for fits.
Each atom is described as a 3D Gaussian distribution of width proportional
to the resolution <i>r</i> and amplitude proportional to the atomic number
(as is done by the command 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/molmap.html"><b>molmap</b></a>).
The grid spacing <i>s</i> is the separation of points 
along the X, Y, and Z axes of the generated map. 
The resolution and spacing should be approximately the same as
for the map into which the structure is being fit (the map that was
<a href="segment.html">segmented</a>).
Clicking <b>Fit</b> or <b>Calculate Map</b> will generate the map from the
structure if it does not already exist.
<br><br>
<li style="list-style-type:none"><b>Which regions to use for fitting</b>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Combined selected regions</b> (default)
  - use the <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> 
  segmentation regions collectively
  <li><b>Each selected region</b>
  - use each <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> 
  segmentation region for a separate fit
  <li><b>Groups of regions including selected region(s)</b>
  - generate groups of segmentation regions that include the
  <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> one, try 
  fitting to each group; save the best fits in the <a href="#table">table</a>
  <li><b>Groups of regions including all regions</b>
  - combinatorially group subsets of all segmentation regions, try 
  fitting to each group; save the best fits in the <a href="#table">table</a>
  </ul>
<br>
<li style="list-style-type:none"><a name="method"><b>Alignment method</b></a>:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Align principal axes (faster - only 4 fits will be tried)</b> (default)
  - align centers, then principal axes from longest to shortest.
  The center and principal axes of a structure are calculated from
  its atomic coordinates, non-mass-weighted.
  The center and principal axes of a region or group of regions
  are calculated from the voxels they enclose;
  all grid points inside the surface(s) are weighted equally.
  The principal axes are the eigenvectors of a covarience matrix. 
  An eigenvector gives the direction of each axis, but the signs of these 
  directions are ambiguous. When performing the alignment, 
  the signs are flipped to generate four possible transforms. 
  Only non-reflecting transforms are considered, in which either 
  none or two of the three axes are flipped.
  The fit with the highest <a href="#corr">correlation</a> is kept.
  <p>
  The principal axes of the atomic structure can be shown/hidden with
  the <b>SegFit</b> <a href="#menu">menu</a>.
  The principal axes of segmentation regions can be shown with the 
  <a href="segment.html#menu-regions"><b>Regions</b>
  menu</a> in <a href="segment.html"><b>Segger</b></a>.
  </p>
  <li><b>Rotational search (try [<i>N</i>] evenly rotated fits)</b> 
  - align centers, then rotate the structure to find the best fit 
  (<i>N</i> orientations tried, default <b>100</b>).
  The alignment with the highest <a href="#corr">correlation</a> is kept.
  </ul>
<br>
<li><a name="mask"><b>Mask map with region(s) to prevent large drifts</b></a>
(off by default) - whether to mask the map with the 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a> segmentation regions,
zeroing voxels outside the region(s) to prevent large displacements during
<a href="#optimize">optimization</a>
<li><b>Use Laplacian filter</b> (off by default) - whether to apply 
<a href="../volumeviewer/gaussian.html#laplacian">Laplacian filtering</a>
to both the target map and the map to fit (which was either specified 
directly or <a href="#molmap">generated from the atomic structure</a>).
This filter may emphasize contours in images and may help to distinguish 
the correct fit from incorrect fits
at medium-to-low resolutions (~10&aring; and lower).
<li><a name="optimize"><b>Optimize fits</b></a> (on by default)
- whether to perform a
<a href="../fitmaps/fitmaps.html#optimization">local optimization</a> of
each fit. Optimization uses density both inside and outside the region(s) 
chosen for fitting (unless the outside density is <a href="#mask">masked</a>) 
and can move a structure far from those region(s).
<li><b>Cluster fits that are &lt; [<i>d</i>] Angstroms and &lt; [<i>a</i>] 
degrees apart</b> (on by default) 
- whether to coalesce fits that are similar in both location 
(center-of-mass translation &lt; <i>d</i>, default <b>5.0</b> &Aring;) 
and orientation (difference in quaternion angle &lt; <i>a</i>, 
default <b>3.0</b>&deg;) into a single fit with their average location
and orientation<br>
<b>Add top [<i>N</i>] fit(s) to list (empty to add all fits to list)</b>
- how many fits to add to the list from the current round of fitting
(all, if <i>N</i> is not specified)
<li><a name="clashes"><b>Clashes with copies from symmetry [<i>sym</i>]</b></a> (off by default)
- whether to evaluate clashes of the fit structure with its copies by
symmetry <i>sym</i> (<i>e.g.</i>, C6); clicking <b>Fit</b> or
<b>Detect</b> will guess the symmetry of the map (see 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/measure.html#symmetry"><b>measure 
symmetry</b></a>) if not already specified.
The &ldquo;clashes&rdquo; reported in the list are 
the fraction of atoms in the fitted structure 
within 3 &Aring; of any atom in its symmetry copies.
<b>Show</b> displays the symmetry copies. The copies can be removed
using the <b>SegFit</b> <a href="#menu">menu</a>.

</ul><ul>
<li><b>Group regions by visible (Molecule) models</b> 
- group regions in the <a href="segment.html#currseg">current segmentation</a>
based on which visible structures they overlap the most
(use <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
<b>S</b> checkboxes to set visibility)
<li><b>Group regions by chains in visible (Molecule) models</b> 
- group regions in the <a href="segment.html#currseg">current segmentation</a>
based on which chains of the visible structures they overlap the most
(use <a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>
