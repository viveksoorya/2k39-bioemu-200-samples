<b>Surfnet</b> identifies molecular cavities and indentations and displays
them as surfaces.  The method is an adaptation of that described in:
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8603061" target="_blank">
SURFNET: a program for visualizing molecular surfaces, cavities, 
and intermolecular interactions.</a>
Laskowski RA.
<i>J Mol Graph.</i> 1995 Oct;13(5):323-30, 307-8.

</p>
<p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Surfnet</b>, a tool in the <b>Surface/Binding Analysis</b> category.
</p><p>
<b>Surfnet</b> finds cavities between two
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/frameatom_spec.html" 
target="_top">specified</a> sets of atoms,
<b>Atom Set 1</b> and <b>Atom Set 2</b>.
The two sets of atoms can be identical, overlapping, or completely different, 
and in the same or different models.
If <b>Atom Set 2</b> is left blank, it is assumed to be the same as
<b>Atom Set 1</b>.
</p><p>
A brief description of the method is needed to explain the options:
<ol>
<li>Pairwise combinations of atoms, one from each set,
are examined for intervening void space.  
Only pairs of atoms no farther apart than the
<b>Distance Cutoff</b> (in &Aring;) are examined.  A "gap
sphere" is placed directly between the two atoms and shrunk until it no
longer intersects the VDW surface of <i>any</i> atom.
<a href="../../UsersGuide/midas/vdwrad.html">Atomic radii</a> are
assigned by Chimera based on inferred atom types.
Gap spheres with radii equal to or greater than the <b>Grid Interval</b>
are retained.
<br><br>
<li>The <b>Density</b> of each gap sphere is smeared out from its center
according to a <b>Gaussian</b> or <b>Quadratic</b> function such that the
value at its radius (100.0 in arbitrary units) is half the value at its
peak (200.0).
<br><br>
<li>At each point in a 3-dimensional grid with <b>Grid Interval</b>
spacing (in &Aring;), only the largest density
contribution from a gap sphere is stored. 
This is not necessarily the contribution from the nearest gap sphere center, 
since the decrease in density with distance depends on radius.
<br><br>
<li>The grid values are used to generate a contour surface at the level
of 100.0, shown in the specified <b>Representation</b>
(<b>Mesh</b> or solid <b>Surface</b>) and
<a href="../../UsersGuide/coloring.html#colorwell"><b>Color</b></a>
(default white).  
</ol>
<b>OK</b> executes a <b>Surfnet</b> calculation
and dismisses the dialog.  <b>Apply</b> runs the calculation
without closing the dialog.  The resulting surface is generated as a 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/surfattrib.html#surfmodels">surface model</a>
and assigned the same model number and transformation as the 
corresponding molecule model (or, if atoms from more than one model
were used, the lowest-numbered of those models).
Each run creates an additional surface model,
which can be hidden or closed using the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/modelpanel.html"><b>Model Panel</b></a>.
</p><p>
<b>Close</b> closes the dialog, and <b>Help</b> opens this
manual page in a browser window.
