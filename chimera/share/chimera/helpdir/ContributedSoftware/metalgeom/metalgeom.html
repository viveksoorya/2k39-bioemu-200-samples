<b>Metal Geometry</b> is a tool for analyzing metal ion 
coordination geometries.  It also allows adding or deleting coordination 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobonds</a>.

</p><p>
There are <a href="../../UsersGuide/extension.html">several ways to start</a>
<b>Metal Geometry</b>, a tool in the <b>Structure Analysis</b> category.
<b>Metal Geometry</b> can also be started by
by double-<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>
a metal ion from the graphics window (doubleclicking it with the button
assigned to <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html#pickselect">picking</a>)
and choosing <b>Coordination Geometry</b> from the resulting 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/mouse.html#contextmenus">context menu</a>.
</p><p>
When multiple metal ions are present, the site of interest
can be chosen from the pulldown menu near the top of the dialog.
Clicking the <b>Next metal</b> button chooses the next metal ion in the list.
The view in the graphics window
will focus on the specified metal ion and nearby atoms.
The <b>Metal transparency</b> slider allows adjusting the transparency of the 
displayed metal ion.

<a name="coordtable">The <b>Coordination Table</b> lists atoms that might
be coordinated to the metal ion, sorted by distance.</a>
<a name="ligset">
Each row represents a <b><i>ligation set</i></b> comprised of not only the atom
named in that row, but also all of the atoms in the rows above it.</a>
Clicking a row chooses that ligation set as the 
<b><i>current ligation set</i></b> and 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selects</a> its atoms.
The rows cannot be reordered, but atoms can be added to or removed from the
list by <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selecting</a> them in
the graphics window and clicking the 
<b>Add</b> or <b>Remove</b> buttons on the right.  
Only one location of an atom with alternate locations can be listed at a time,
and which location is listed can be controlled with the <b>Alt loc</b> menu
to the right of the table.
Columns:
<ul>
<li><b>Coordinator</b> - a potentially metal-ligating atom, listed in the
<b>Atomspec display style</b> specified in the
<a href="../../UsersGuide/preferences.html#Labels"><b>Labels</b> preferences</a>
<li><b>Distance (&Aring;)</b> 
- distance in &Aring; from that atom to the metal ion
<li><b>Distance RMSD</b> 
- root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the 
<a href="#ligset">ligation set</a> and metal ion 
from their idealized positions in the <b>Best Geometry</b> for that set 
(<a href="#details">details...</a>)
<li><b>Best Geometry</b> - the coordination geometry for which the
<a href="#ligset">ligation set</a> has the lowest <b>Distance RMSD</b>
(additional geometries can be shown in the 
<a href="#geomtable"><b>Geometry Table</b></a>)
</ul>
Clicking <b>Create/Update</b> will generate or delete coordination 
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobonds</a> to the
metal as needed to represent the <a href="#ligset">current ligation set</a>.
Clicking <b>Display options...</b> brings up a list of
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbattrib.html#group">pseudobond attributes</a>
for this group, allowing changes in properties
such as color, linewidth, and whether the lines are dashed.
When an individual
<a href="../../UsersGuide/pbpanel.html#pbdef">pseudobond</a>
is <a href="../../UsersGuide/selection.html">selected</a>,
its attributes
can be altered with the <a href="../../UsersGuide/inspection.html">
<b>Selection Inspector</b></a>.
</p><p>
<a name="geomtable">The <b>Geometry Table</b> 
lists possible metal coordination geometries</a> 
for the <a href="#ligset">current ligation set</a>,
subject to certain <a href="#screens">screening criteria</a>.
Columns:
<ul>
<li><b>Geometry</b> - coordination geometry
<li><a name="coordno"><b>Coord. Number</b></a>
- total number of metal-ligating atoms needed to fill
the <b>Geometry</b>
<li><b>Distance RMSD</b> - RMSD of the 
<a href="#ligset">ligation set</a> and metal ion
from their idealized positions in the <b>Geometry</b> 
(<a href="#details">details...</a>); the <b>Geometry</b>
for which this is lowest is reported as the <b>Best Geometry</b> in the 
<a href="#coordtable"><b>Coordination Table</b></a>
</ul>
Clicking a row in the <b>Geometry Table</b> chooses that
metal coordination geometry. <b>Depict idealized geometry</b> 
shows the chosen geometry with arrow objects, 
and water oxygens can be <b>Add</b>ed to occupy any unfilled sites.
The distance from the metal at which to add water oxygens
is automatically set to the average for the
<a href="#ligset">current ligation set</a>, but can be edited.
</p><p>
<a name="screens">
Unlikely geometries can be screened out of the tables:
</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Screen unfilled geometries</b> (default <b>off</b>)
- disregard coordination geometries with
<a href="#coordno">coordination number</a> greater than the
number of atoms in the <a href="#ligset">current ligation set</a> 
<li><b>Screen "overcrowded" geometries</b> (default <b>on</b>)
- disregard coordination geometries that would place ligating atoms too close
together, given their likely distance from the metal ion.
Clicking <b>Show parameters</b> expands the dialog to reveal additional
settings for this screen: 
<blockquote>
A geometry is considered overcrowded if hypothetical metal-ligating atoms
placed at the ideal angles for that geometry, at a distance equal to the
[<b>average</b> | maximum | minimum ] of the actual chosen ligating atoms,
would be less than <i>mindist</i> (default <b>2.8</b>) &Aring; apart.
</blockquote>
Clicking <b>Hide parameters</b> hides the overcrowding settings.
</ul>
<b>Close</b> closes the <b>Metal Geometry</b> dialog. 
<b>Help</b> opens this manual page in a browser window.
</p>

<h3><a name="details">Distance RMSD</a></h3>
<p>
In an idealized coordination geometry, the ligating atoms fall along
vectors that emanate from the metal ion.  The angles between
the vectors are characteristic of the specific <b>Geometry</b>.
The radiating set of vectors is repositioned to coincide as much
as possible with the real positions of the metal ion and ligating atoms,
and then for each real ligating atom, an idealized ligating atom is placed 
along the corresponding vector at the same distance from the idealized metal 
ion as the real atom is from the real metal ion.
The best-fit root-mean-square deviation between the real atoms 
(including the metal ion) and their idealized positions is computed.
