Less than half the total residues across all samples had  angles calculated; Does this have to do with disallowed conformations; less than 3 percent of the residues were disallowed; the issue it is only recognizing 5912, when the total number of residues would be 194 * 74 = 14356; It is not that the ones it is recognizing are allowed, it has disallowed residues within the 5k odd residues it recognizes; the issue is that not all residues are being recognized; It looks the residues that are not recognized correspond to the residues for whom errors were thrown in the log file; example: “Error : Unable to calculate  torsion angles sample_33-fixed.pdb ChainA Residue 1 MET PHI:None PSI:128.19322269854987 Omega:None “; This suggests that more than half of the residues across all 194 conformations generated, are not feasible in the way they are generated; Is there a decisive test for this; is it possible that the software  is in the wrong here;
