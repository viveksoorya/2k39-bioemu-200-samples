# Current Working Memory
### understanding structures generated by bioemu

1) Why the strands and helices of samples predicted by bioemu open up: Bioemu samples excited states and so the strands and helices open up

2) The reason for uneven arrows is that bioemu does functionally relevant sampling; so it registers transition states with a great propensity, unlike NMR samples that almost always register stable states. Bioemu samples excited states and so the strand and helices open up.

### Process as is:
conda create –name bioemu
conda install pip
pip install bioemu
python -m bioemu.sample --sequence MQIFVKTLTGKTITLEVEPSDTIENVKAKIQDKEGIPPDQQRLIFAGKQLEDGRTLSDYNIQKESTLHLVLRLRGG --num_samples 200 --output_dir ./test-bioemu-ubq
[ran into error with this last command due to python version incompatibility; the following two commands delete the earlier conda env]
conda env remove -p /home/uni/miniconda3/envs/bioemu
rm -rf /home/uni/miniconda3/envs/bioemu
[the following command rebuilds conda environment using appropriate python version]
conda create -n bioemu python=3.12
conda install pip
pip install bioemu 
[Here I realized that I already have side-chain reconstructed pdb and xtc files, so I installed pdbfixer and openmm using conda’s base environment and added hydrogen atoms to the pdb. Now there are 1231 atoms!]
conda deactivate
conda install -c conda-forge openmm
conda install -c conda-forge pdbfixer

Now that I have a universe object with 1231 atoms each for bioemu generated samples and for the NMR ensemble, I can run comparable analyses, and see what the results show
Now that the workflow is down, I can replicate the analyses with other proteins
But before that, we need to fix the trajectory file, I need to render the samples using bioemu, run it through MDAnalysis file to generate and write out PDB files, reconstruct side chains, hydrogenate all PDB files and put them together in a multimodal PDB file

### Interactive Python Notebook Analysis pipeline Overview:
0 to 300 
Activate bioemu env 
Run the python command (bioemu samples generator) outputs to an output_dir
Deactivate bioemu env
Workflow of 300 to 600 (switch to hpacker env just for the sidechain reconstruction)
Clone gvisani/hpacker
cd hpacker
Create hpacker env and activate it
pip install -e .
cd ..
python 300-odd-atoms-to-600-odd-atoms.py
python 600-odd-atoms-to1200-odd-atoms.py -f topology-600-atoms.pdb -o topology-1200-atoms.pdb
Note that PDBfixer produces a different output every time in fixing hydrogen atoms (orientation of H atoms wise).
600 to 1200 (hydrogenation using pdbfixer) using base env or bioemu env
Multiple sample files to a single trajectory file
Run python analysis notebook using base env or bioemu env
Hpacker always comes as a separate environment, so if you use a separate environment for bioemu as well, then you have at least three conda environments: base (that you may not use for this project), bioemu env and hpacker env. Now, if you use base environment for bioemu, then you have at least two environments: base and hpacker.

Use MDAnalysis to render individual frames
