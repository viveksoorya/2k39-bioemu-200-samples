Email professor sudip updating him with progress done in the last two weeks
push the repo to github
try and plot boltzmann distribution of the conformations samples to find energy of the conformation
check if the coil in residues 71 to 76 has learnt structure
check if there is an uppper limit to number of samples
interpret the graph pc1 vs pc2
find what temperature bioemu samples conformations at
